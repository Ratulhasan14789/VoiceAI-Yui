I AWOKE TO MOVEMENTS THAT WEREN’T MINE, warmth that wasn’t
mine, and breathing that wasn’t mine.
Through cracked eyelids, I saw the faint, white-gray light of morning.
Based on the color, I gauged it to be around five in the morning.
Normally, I’d still be asleep at this hour, but I’d gone to bed very
early and had already gotten nine hours of sleep. We were set to
meet with Kizmel in the mess hall at seven, so there was still time to
relax, but I decided it was better not to be lazy.
And yet, my eyes closed again. The chilly air of the early January
morning versus the absolute comfort and warmth of the bed was
simply an unfair fight. My partially awakened mind sank back down
into the darkness.
Just thirty more minutes…No, twenty, I thought like a middle
schooler on a Monday morning and then tried to turn off my brain.
But then there was a faint “Mmh…” and a sensation of wriggling next
to me. At first, I thought I was having a dream about owning a cat,
but then I realized it was neither a cat nor a dream.
My eyelids were so heavy that they felt like they’d been glued
together; even though the virtual world didn’t make use of your
actual eyes, the way it made it impossible to focus when in a halfasleep state was oddly true to life—probably an issue between the
brain and the NerveGear. I blinked repeatedly until the gray blur
sharpened into a proper image.
The upper half of my field of view was dominated by a large pillow,
while the bottom half was a light-brown something. I was resting on
my right side, I could tell, and my right arm was extended forward,
trapped between the brown object and the pillow.

16|P

My left arm was resting on a soft object, and my legs felt intertwined
with something, as well. They were either trapping it or being
entrapped themselves; it was hard to tell for sure. I blinked some
more, using my free arm to try to push away the enigma stuck to my
body…
“Nnuh…” came another murmur, from somewhere under my chin.
The soft object my left hand was touching suddenly wriggled.
It wasn’t a cat or any other small animal. It was a large animal, about
my size—a human. A player. Specifically, it was my temporary
partner, Lady Asuna. The brown object resting on my right arm was
Asuna’s head.
The instant the situation registered in my mind, it accelerated from a
dazed state past normal attention into hyper-focus. As my mind got
up to speed, I chose my course of action.
Apparently, I had offered my arm as pillow space and had my free
hand holding her shoulder. I was on my right side, and Asuna was on
her left, meaning that our fronts were nearly in total contact, and I
couldn’t tell what was going on with our legs. I moved my eyes
without craning my neck to glance up at the headboard. I was firmly
on the left side of the bed—meaning that I was the one violating the
territorial treaty. We were only holding pinkies when we went to
sleep, so during the night I had somehow advanced all the way from
east to west.
“Uyu…”
Asuna budged again. The intervals of her activity were getting
shorter, and within minutes…perhaps less than a minute, she would
likely awaken. I had to retreat to my territory on the right side of the
bed before that happened.

17|P

18|P

Carefully, I let go of Asuna’s shoulder and let my hand hover in the
air. But my right arm was still trapped between her head and the
pillow, and removing it would prove difficult. Not to mention our
legs, which were all tangled. At this point, the only way to free
myself without disturbing Asuna would require a teleport crystal, but
those only allowed for teleport to the various town teleport gates—
and more importantly, they weren’t available on the sixth floor.
Still, I had time to attempt it, should I believe in miracles—and I
didn’t have much other choice. I tried to use my left hand to lift up
Asuna’s head. If I could get my right arm free, I might be able to undo
our legs and escape.
“Mmmh…”
The moment my fingers brushed the back of her head, Asuna
grimaced. I quickly moved my hand away. She wriggled for a few
more seconds, then unfolded her hand right in front of her and
clenched my shirt collar.
I’m so dead.
At this point, all I could do was let my muscles go limp and wait for
the fateful moment to occur.
Two hours later…
“…Why are you putting your fish on Asuna’s plate, Kirito? Do you not
like fish?” Kizmel asked me. We were in the dining hall.
With a sad, secretive smile, I replied, “No, I love fish,” in the dry tone
of a sample sentence in a language textbook.
“Then why are you giving it all away?”
“Um…”
I was at a loss for an appropriate response. Instead, Asuna stuck her
fork into the fried fish I was offering her and happily explained,
“Kirito did something bad, so he’s paying for his crime.”
19|P

“Oh…What did he do?”
“Well…” Asuna started, but before she could detail the entire
incident, I interjected.
“You see, I kind of invaded Asuna’s personal space…er, meaning that
I got a little too physically close for her comfort,” I said, to explain
the English terminology of personal space. I got a cold glare from the
fencer for my comment. Yes, the act of embracing someone in a bed
was beyond the level of “violation of personal space,” but if Kizmel
was going to be disgusted with me, too, I might as well spend the
entire day doing squats in the corner of the castle by myself.
I prayed she would understand and accept this explanation,
assuming that she actually wouldn’t. But to my good fortune, Kizmel
nodded deeply and earnestly. “I see. It is the first time I have heard
this term, but I understand your meaning. In elf society, too, it is
considered to be a violation of norms to approach another too
closely.”
“Oh, really?” asked Asuna to my right. She set down her cup of
herbal tea and wondered, “But…when you’re around us, you don’t
seem to keep your distance, Kizmel…In the queen spider’s dungeon
on the third floor, you ushered us under your cape of hiding, for
example.”
Indeed, I recalled being rather flustered at how much contact there
had been with her arms and legs and other body parts. The elf knight
smiled wistfully and glanced at her own hands.
“…Yes, I do recall that. It would seem that, compared to other dark
elves, my persi…personal space…is rather narrow. Tilnel did like to
cling to me, after all…We were practically joined at the hip when we
were children, so I suppose I became used to the feeling.”

20|P

I could sense Asuna’s eyes widening when Kizmel mentioned the
name of her late sister, who had died in battle with a Forest Elven
Falconer on the third floor.
Asuna and I never met Tilnel. In fact, I was under the assumption
that there had never actually been a dark elf NPC in Aincrad named
Tilnel. Kizmel’s childhood with her beloved sister, the point at which
she became a knight and Tilnel became an herbalist, and Tilnel’s
death during the mission to recover the sacred key…All these things
had to be backstory, details invented and placed in Kizmel’s memory.
For one thing, elves were long-lived, so Kizmel was older than she
appeared, perhaps fifty or sixty, or even older than that. Yet, the
world of Aincrad itself had only been around since November 6,
2022, less than two months ago in the real world.
But after all my interactions with Kizmel, Viscount Yofilis, and even
old Romolo and the camp blacksmith, that way of thinking was
slowly evolving. These things seemed too rich and complex to just be
simple generated memories that were implanted to define the
characters and give them individuality.
In the present day of 2022—er, no, it was 2023 now, I had to remind
myself—humanity had yet to develop a properly functioning AGI, or
artificial general intelligence.
Artificial intelligence itself had made great strides in the five years
since 2017, which was now considered the first year of the AI era.
There were shogi and go apps you could install on your smartphone
that were tougher than any pro players, programs for stock and
currency trading that could perform thousands of transactions per
second for efficient gains, and hospitals now had tools to
automatically perform diagnostics with high-res imaging. It wouldn’t
be long now before we reached level 5, the point where fully
automated cars were driving around on public streets.

21|P

But compared to the rapid advancements of these “narrow AI,”
which were focused on specific tasks, we still had a long way to go to
develop a “general AI” that was capable of learning on its own and
communicating on the same level as a human being. Once that level
of intelligence had been achieved, the AI could then be applied to a
wide variety of areas. Smart speakers were found in homes all over
the world, helping with schedule management, home appliances,
and information searches, but they were clearly unable to contribute
meaningfully to conversation.
For one thing, AI are good at learning about things with clear
outcomes—winning and losing, correct and incorrect—but struggle
greatly when there is no correct answer to discern. The concepts of
winning and losing don’t apply to normal conversation.
Yet, here before me, sipping her herbal tea with a pensive,
thoughtful look, was a dark elf NPC in a video game—not exactly the
pinnacle of cutting-edge AI development—who had never once given
us a nonsense response to any statement. Perhaps that was partly
because we’d been avoiding bringing up any topics that Kizmel would
not understand, but even then, her ability to make conversation was
essentially at a human level.
How had Argus—had Akihiko Kayaba—managed to implement such
a high-functioning AI in a video game? There was only one way I
could imagine: to build up an enormous text corpus of conversations
between a vast number of humans and AI on specific topics and then
reduce statistical noise and computational stress. That would not be
easy, of course. It would be hard enough just to get hundreds of
people to participate and explain what was allowed to discuss and
what was off-limits. And there would be the issue of how to recruit
them and how to pay them for their time and efforts.
But in a VRMMO world…

22|P

Players would generally only speak about in-game topics and quests,
and who needed to pay them when they would happily log in and
spend hours in the game at a time? If a thousand players spoke with
AI over the course of a month, you would accumulate the kind of
data that no company or researchers had ever gotten their hands on
before.
Then, using that text corpus, they could have AIs talk to one another.
Once actual humans were out of the picture, that conversation could
be simulated much, much faster. In two months, you could simulate
centuries or more of dialogue between individual AIs.
Meaning that it was possible that Kizmel and the dark elves…and
forest elves, and fallen elves, and human NPCs…had all built up an
actual history that started from the creation of Aincrad before SAO
officially launched. And among them were special AIs with
conversational abilities close to a general intelligence, such as Kizmel
and Viscount Yofilis.
If my imagination—no, my daydream—was even in the vicinity of the
truth, then SAO’s AI capability was already in that “near-future”
realm.
Now you had ten times as many players as in the beta, a full ten
thousand in Aincrad, all trading words with AIs every day. Could that
data be accumulated, refined, and polished enough to lead to the
production of a crown jewel of true artificial intelligence? I certainly
couldn’t categorically rule it out…
“…Um, Kirito.”
A poke at my elbow brought me to a rapid series of blinks.
“Hweh? Wh…what?”
“Don’t what me. Was it that much of a shock that I took your fish?
You’ve barely eaten a bite so far.”

23|P

“Oh…”
I looked down at my plate, where I still had two pieces of fried fish
after the one I’d offered to Asuna, and I hadn’t even touched my
salad or toast. The day’s adventure was expected to be a long one, so
I needed to fuel up while I could—even if the calories weren’t real. I
stabbed a piece of fish with my fork and shoved the whole thing in
my mouth. The crisply fried portion crumbled apart, giving way to a
juicy chunk of white meat. As I cleaned my plate, I couldn’t help but
wonder if Kizmel and her kind felt the same sensations of taste and
contentment. Once I had polished off my food, I gulped down my
herbal tea.
“I wasn’t asking you to inhale it, you know,” Asuna muttered. I
leaned over and bit down on the elliptical baby tomato stuck on the
end of her fork, pulling it off. “Aaah! What was that for?!”
Asuna raised her fork to swing, and I held my knife to defend against
it. Kizmel only shook her head, a big-sister gesture if I’d ever seen
one. Asuna noticed it and lowered her arm.
“Hey, Kizmel, can you tell us more about Tilnel?”
“Hmm…? Why, yes, of course. I shall tell you some stories on our
travels today.”
“Great. I can’t wait to hear them.” Asuna beamed, earning her a grin
from the dark elf. There was no hint of shadow in her expression this
time.
After our meal, Kizmel guided us to the supply station of Castle
Galey. They were very generous, offering us five healing potions, five
antidote potions, and a bag with rations and snacks, once per day,
for free. Sadly, the antidotes were only level 1, so they couldn’t
counteract the level-2 paralyzing poison from Morte’s Spine of
Shmargor throwing picks.

24|P

The prospect of finding an antidote that was effective against the
poision had me excited to hear from the storyteller that Kizmel had
mentioned last night, but unfortunately, we could only meet them in
the library between noon and three o’clock.
I didn’t like the idea of continuing our questing without a means to
neutralize the poison picks, but we would probably be fine as long as
Kizmel was with us. She had a ring with magical antidote charms, and
I couldn’t imagine that Morte’s gang would attack an elite knight
whose level was so high that her color cursor must seem black.
Based on the way the dagger user, aka Black Hood Number Two, had
given up his main weapon to try to save Morte—or Mamoru, as he
called him—they hadn’t engaged in that stunt expecting to sacrifice
their lives.
But that just meant that when they tried to attack us again, it would
be under even more advantageous circumstances than the other
night. The next time, they would do whatever it took to kill us; and
they were probably working on their diabolical plan at this very
moment.
I felt a fresh wave of apprehension about the idea of just waiting for
them to make their next move, but I couldn’t think of a way we could
strike them first; and even if I did have a plan, I would need
willpower on a different level than what I was working with now. For
one thing, assuming we knew where their hideout was, there was no
surefire method for apprehending a player in Aincrad for long
periods of time. The only way to prevent them from committing any
more evil would be to permanently log them out of the game.
And the only way to do that for sure at this point in time was to
reduce their HP to zero. Which would bring about the death of the
player in real life…
“Hey, Kirito, we’re going to head out!”

25|P

“Don’t make us leave you behind!”
I lifted my gaze from the tiles on the floor to the distance, where I
saw the knight and fencer beckoning me toward the spring at the
roots of the spirit tree.
The branches and leaves of the massive tree, which emerged from
the center of the pool, glistened dazzlingly with countless droplets of
dew that caught the morning sun and dripped down like golden
threads. The sight of the two women against this backdrop was
astonishingly beautiful.
Kizmel was Kizmel, of course, but at this point, Asuna might be
stronger than me in pure fighting prowess as well. Even still, I felt a
powerful urge to protect the two of them surge up from my heart as
I trotted over to join them.
We were ushered out of the castle gates by the sound of the light
bells and the silent gazes of the guards. After barely a minute of
walking across the bridge built over the sandy valley floor, devoid of
so much as a blade of grass, an unfamiliar debuff icon appeared on
Kizmel’s HP bar.
The symbol of a person hanging their head was the status icon for
weakness, I recalled. I only suffered it once in the beta, fighting
against the snake priests in the Castle of a Thousand Serpents on the
tenth floor. It wiped out a large portion of my strength and agility
stats, which put me in an encumbered state. Unable to run away to
safety, I was killed soon after that.
Kizmel didn’t look to be that bad, but I could tell in the brief time it
had been that her rich, coffee-brown skin was looking noticeably
paler now. Asuna called out her name in concern and tried to offer
her an arm, but the knight boldly pushed her away and removed a
thin cape from a pouch she kept fixed to her back.

26|P

“…I thought…that I could last longer…but this is merely a reminder
that we elves are powerless without the bounty of the forest and
water,” she grunted, switching out her usual hiding cloak for the
cape.
Like Asuna’s, this cape was hooded, and it was a mysterious shade of
green with silver tinting—I could even make out a pattern that
looked like leaf veins. The moment she pulled the hood over her
head, Kizmel’s weakness icon disappeared and was replaced by a
new buff icon.
“Whew…” Already the color was returning to her face. Asuna and I
were so stunned by the immediate improvement that the knight
gave us a proud little grin. “This cape is a special treasure that has
been kept within the kingdom since before the Great Separation. It is
carefully sewn together from the precious leaves of the Holy Tree,
which hardly ever fall, even in midwinter…Among all the castles and
fortresses together there are no more than ten of these capes
remaining.”
“Ooooh…That’s fascinating,” Asuna whispered, examining the cape
itself. “So it’s made from the leaves of the Holy Tree…”
Meanwhile, I was more curious about the effects of the new leaf
icon—but I couldn’t just go tapping Kizmel’s cape while she was
wearing it. I made a mental note to ask her permission to examine it
once we got back to Castle Galey and opened my main menu to
check the quest log.
We were about to tackle the main story for the “Elf War” campaign
quest on the sixth floor, known as the “Agate Key.” The format of the
quest itself was simple—collect the key from the dungeon in the
south area and return it to the castle—but the problem was that out
of the five radial areas around the center of the sixth floor, we were
in the northwest, meaning we’d have to get through the west area
just to get to the south.
27|P

That meant getting through two of the boundary dungeons that
separated each area—the first of which was a decent challenge for a
full raid party with the ALS and DKB, plus the Bro Squad for backup.
Even with Kizmel, that was not going to be easy…Just in case, I
checked our route there.
“Um, Kizmel, about our destination…I presume we’re heading for the
Key Shrine at the southernmost part of the sixth floor?”
“That is correct. I am impressed you knew the shrine was in the
south,” Kizmel said with marvel. Obviously, I couldn’t tell her I’d been
there in the beta test, so I gave her a pat answer about
understanding as much with my book of Mystic Scribing. As a matter
of fact, the quest log did include the location of the dungeon, so it
wasn’t really a lie.
“I see. Your human magical charms are powerful, indeed,” the knight
remarked. I walked up to show her the full map of the sixth floor,
which Asuna examined from the opposite side. They traced the
pathway to our destination with a finger.
“Our present location is here, and the shrine with the key is
somewhere around here. That means we have to get through the
passageway under the mountains both here and here…That’s going
to be a serious challenge if we attempt to tackle them head-on, but if
there happens to be some kind of secret shortcut known only to dark
elves, then…” I prompted. Asuna elbowed me in the side.
“Now, don’t be tacky. I’m sorry, Kizmel, please ignore him.”
“Hrmm. I do not remember hearing anything about a shortcut,” the
knight replied. She looked up and grinned. “But there is no need to
cross the mountains at all.”
“Uh…why not?”
“We can save that surprise for later. Let’s head to the center lake
first.”
28|P

Kizmel put a hand on my back and Asuna’s and pushed us onward, so
I had to close my window and start walking.
The star-shaped body of water in the center of the floor was named
Lake Talpha, and it would indeed cut down on travel time
significantly if you could cross it. In the beta, many players did use
buoyant materials in an attempt to swim across it, but the lake was
home to a devastatingly powerful giant starfish monster that
grabbed every person attempting to cross and dragged them down
to watery graves.
That would be a thrilling bit of entertainment in a normal game, but
encountering that starfish in SAO now was nothing short of suicide.
The thought of Kizmel’s intentions was troubling, but I had no choice
at present other than to trust her.
The three of us crossed the stone bridge and headed into the
labyrinth of canyon walls. Sandy monsters promptly began to spawn
around us, but Kizmel was even stronger than when we worked with
her on the sacred key quest of the fifth floor, and with ease, she
dispatched the desert spiders and death worms that gave us so much
trouble.
In terms of leveling efficiency, SAO was a lonely game in which the
best way to level was going solo, but for now, there was no
experience-point adjustment based on the level gap between
monster and player—meaning that power leveling, where one or
two over-leveled players could boost a party by taking down huge
numbers of monsters by themselves, was surprisingly easy. This was
exactly the present case, so I wished we could find a good highfrequency monster area and hang out for two or three hours—
maybe even half a day or a full day—to gain levels. But given that we
were on an important quest to recover the sacred keys, I couldn’t ask
Kizmel to do that. (In fact, didn’t I consider that very idea on the third
floor already?)
29|P

To my disappointment, we mostly avoided combat as we proceeded
southward through the sandy canyons, and we reached the hills on
the other end of the area by ten o’clock.
The five equal-sized areas of the sixth floor were spread out like a
fan, so the closer you got to the lake in the center, the narrower the
band of terrain became. About five hundred meters to our left was a
sheer rocky cliff face, and if I squinted, I could see the entrance to
the cave path we came through yesterday at the base of the rocks far
ahead.
There was a similar rock wall on the right side, but the tunnel
through that range was located toward the outer perimeter of the
floor—and not visible from here. The walls would steadily close
tighter and tighter until we hit star-shaped Lake Talpha at the center.
“Whew…Finally, we’ve made it through the dry valley,” remarked
Kizmel, pulling off her green hood.
“H-hey, is it safe for you to take that off yet?” I balked.
“It is. There are at least a few plants in this region, with the
occasional spring of water.”
But as far as I could see, the surrounding wasteland was just barren,
reddish-brown ground, with the only visible plants being spiky cacti
and succulents. It did not seem to be overflowing with the “bounty
of forest and water,” but the knight removed her cape anyway.
The debuff icon did not reappear, but even after two hours under
the cape, her face still looked pale and uncomfortable. Asuna noticed
it, too, and asked, “Are you sure you shouldn’t keep it on until we
reach the lake?”
“Yes…As I said earlier, this Greenleaf Cape is very precious. It would
be a disgrace to our ancestors if I wore it where it was not necessary
and damaged it in combat,” Kizmel replied, folding the cape carefully

30|P

and storing it in a pouch. She removed her cloak of hiding with a long
exhale and put that on instead.
I opened my inventory and materialized a bottle of water for her,
which she accepted gratefully. Then I retrieved two more for Asuna
and me, and the three of us quenched our thirst standing in a row.
For some reason, I felt like striking a pose with my left hand on my
waist, but I didn’t, out of fear that my companions wouldn’t join in.
When the bottle was half empty, I stowed it. A player could carry as
much food and water as the carrying limit would allow, but the elves
didn’t have fancy player inventories and had to carry around all their
belongings by hand.
The same went for human NPCs, which meant that when Morte
killed Cylon, all the gold and silver coins that he dropped were stored
somewhere under his robes.
I bet the lord of the town has a pretty heavy purse, I thought, which
was neither here nor there, but the thought gave me pause. When
Cylon died, he dropped both the golden key he stole from us and an
iron key. By this logic, he either carried it around with him at all
times, or he took it out of his mansion to use it. If the latter, it would
only make sense that wherever Cylon intended to take Asuna and me
while we were paralyzed, the iron key would be needed.
When I finished the paralysis event by myself in the beta, Pithagrus’s
servant and secret protégé, Theano, had saved me in the back
streets of Stachion, so I didn’t know where the carriage was
supposed to end up. And I didn’t recall any iron key being involved in
the series of quests that followed. So if Morte hadn’t killed Cylon, I
doubted we would have seen any iron keys this time, either.
Meaning that the key I had in my inventory now was an item the
game only generated when Cylon died in the middle of the

31|P

quest…and that there was an alternate “dead Cylon” route to the
“Curse of Stachion” quest, most likely.
Without thinking, I was scrolling through my open inventory window
looking for the iron key. I had to grab my wrist with the other hand
to stop it. Now was the time to focus on the “Agate Key” quest, not
the “Curse of Stachion.” We could return to Stachion at any time,
and more importantly, if Kizmel could help us cross Lake Talpha, we
could probably jump ahead of the other frontier players making their
way counterclockwise around the map.
“Okay, let’s go—” I started to say, but then I noticed that Asuna and
Kizmel were busy with their backs to me, facing a rather large cactus.
I walked over to check what they were doing and saw that they were
plucking something red from between the cactus spikes and lifting it
to their mouths.
“Hey! You’re eating something!” I shouted. Asuna glanced at me
briefly before returning to her harvest. She was even doing it twohanded now, popping the red objects into her mouth at twice the
speed.
Determined not to be left out, I circled around to the other side of
the cactus and examined the base of the nearly ten-centimeter long
spikes of the red object there. Gingerly, I reached in and plucked out
a round fruit less than three centimeters across. When I hesitantly
bit down on it, juice burst forth that was sweet and cold and sour
and fizzy, numbing my mind with pleasure.
Immediately certain that the flavor was greater than even the B-rank
half-fish sweet potatoes, I went in for another one, but perhaps
because my hands were bigger than theirs, I couldn’t pick the fruit as
quickly. By the time I had pulled off a third fruit, Asuna was already
rotating her way around from the other side.

32|P

She’s going to eat my share! I fretted, and in my haste to grab a
fourth fruit, my hand slipped and embedded itself onto a cactus
spike.
“Yeow!!”
Like with the sensations of combat, it wasn’t real pain, but I snatched
my hand away out of sheer instinct anyway. Asuna took the
opportunity to snatch the fruit and pop it into her mouth.
In the end, I only got about ten of the fruit by the time the entire
cactus was picked clean. I looked at my two satisfied companions
and grumbled. “I can’t believe this. You could have told me before
you started eating them…”
“Ha-ha, I am sorry for that, Kirito.” Kizmel, who seemed to be in
much better spirits, laughed. Perhaps the cactus fruit had some
healing properties. “These Celusian Fruit have the most exquisite
taste, but the flowers bloom and produce fruit only once a year. And
what’s more, the fruit can appear during any season, because the
fruits fall just thirty minutes after they grow. So when you see them,
you must eat them as quickly as you can.”
“Th-thirty minutes…?” I repeated, looking out on the desert wastes.
There were over a hundred cacti dotting the landscape just from
what I could see, but a year would be 8,760 hours long, meaning
525,600 minutes, only thirty of which would feature any fruit on an
individual cactus. The odds of actually happening across a fruiting
cactus had to be devastatingly low. It wouldn’t be worth wandering
across the desert in search of them, no matter how tasty they were,
so that might be the first and last time I would ever get the chance. I
turned to my temporary partner, who still seemed to be basking in
the afterglow of her meal.
“Um, Asuna?”
“Ahhh…what?”
33|P

“How many of those cactus fruits did you eat?”
“Around forty or fifty. I could go for more, though…Just give me a
whole bathtub full of them.”
“Hrrr…!” I moaned, swearing to myself that I would have to come
back to search for them after all.
Kizmel clapped me on the shoulder. “Let us be on our way now. At
this point, those pesky insect monsters will not bother us anymore.”
As she said, the monsters that popped up in the hilly region mainly
resembled coyotes and lizards, and neither had venom, making them
much easier to dispatch. Instead, we spent the last kilometer or so
listening to Kizmel tell us stories about her sister Tilnel, which had
been a focus of Asuna’s curiosity.
The story about how she took out a rowboat into the lake near the
royal city on the ninth floor, all by herself as a child, and got lost for a
full day. The story about how she put too much extract of juniper
into the bath and smelled like a tree for a week. The story of how she
gave Kizmel an experimental tonic during her herbalist studies that
turned Kizmel’s hair as green as a dryad’s.
Asuna giggled at all the stories, and they reminded me of the
experiences I had with my sister Suguha years ago, but I couldn’t
help entertaining one unsettling thought in the back of my mind. If
all of Kizmel’s memories of Tilnel were just “backstory,” implanted
memories, then they were all things that the staff of Argus, some
scenario writer, had come up with originally.
But would they really give such a rich backstory to Kizmel, who was
just one of potentially countless NPCs that populated Aincrad? There
seemed to be no end to the knight’s stories; it was as though she
recalled every single day that she had spent with her sister Tilnel. If it
wasn’t just special NPCs like Kizmel and Viscount Yofilis who had
such richness of memory, but every single NPC in the game…it would
34|P

be impossible for even a team of writers to come up with so much
material.
For close to an hour we walked, Kizmel’s stories entering my left ear
and smoke from my overheating brain exiting the right. At last, the
gap between the two mountain walls ahead reached barely half a
kilometer, with the shining blue surface of the lake visible beyond.
We shared a glance, then sprinted the rest of the way until we
reached the water.
“Ooooh, wow!” Asuna exclaimed, and I couldn’t blame her. The
sharply curved water’s edge was a pure-white beach with stunningly
clear water lapping at its sand. The surface was dazzling in the
sunlight, the water transitioning from emerald green to cobalt blue
as it deepened. Even the air seemed a bit warmer here.
Compared to the ten-kilometer diameter of the first floor, Lake
Talpha was not all that big, but it was still over half a kilometer
across, the far bank fading into the distance. However, the rocky
walls that split the floor into five equal sections were clearly visible
on the far right and left—and straight ahead of us. It was clear at a
glance that this was the center where the five areas met.
“Hey, can I go in the water for just a bit?” Asuna asked. She was
inching closer and closer to the sand. I was going to warn her, but
Kizmel beat me to it.
“No, you must not. This lake is home to a dreadful starfish monster…I
have never seen it for myself, but they say its tremendously long
arms can reach the shore all the way from the depths of the lake.”
Asuna immediately shrank away.
So the giant starfish, which went by the name Ophiometus, was still
in place at the bottom of the lake in the release version. Now I was
really curious and worried about Kizmel’s plan to get to the far bank.

35|P

The knight sensed my eyes on her and smiled confidently. She pulled
a new item out of her carrying pouch: a small glass bottle no bigger
than her thumb. There was a pure-blue liquid inside it.
“Kirito, show me the bottom of your boot.”
“O…kay,” I agreed, but even in a virtual world, lifting my leg high
enough for the sole of my shoe to be visible was easier said than
done. I managed to get my right leg up, trying to stretch my ankle
and pelvis as far as they could go, but about when I had the leg
perpendicular to the ground, I lost my balance, yelped, waved my
arms, and toppled onto the sandy beach.
Asuna’s spontaneous laughter was stifled with a muffled Poom!
Embarrassed, I wanted to jump back to my feet, but Kizmel said
“Perfect, that will do,” and she had me lie back with my feet sticking
straight up into the air, which didn’t make me feel any better.
She carefully unstopped the bottle and put a single drop each on my
soles. The shoes began to glow blue all over, and another unfamiliar
icon lit up over my HP bar. I could guess what it meant, given the
illustration of a shoe standing on water, but I waited for Kizmel to
explain it anyway.
“You may stand,” she said. I pulled my legs back over the position of
my head, then snapped them forward to jump up to my feet in one
motion. I needed to be in the best possible vantage point to witness
my partner’s sense of balance, after she had so kindly laughed at me
falling on my butt.
Asuna shot me a glare, said “Go ahead, Kizmel,” and lifted her right
leg, not forward, but behind her, propping her ankle up with a hand.
Of course, that was a much easier way to expose the bottom of one’s
foot without any awkward strain on the joints. In fact, probably nine
out of ten people would do the same thing. I was both impressed
and disgruntled by the idea. “No fair,” I groused.
36|P

After sprinkling her own boots at the end, Kizmel put the cork back in
the bottle and returned it to her pouch. Then she crossed the sand
and gingerly stepped onto the clear water where it ebbed and
flowed against the shore. The first few steps went through the
surface, but around the fourth, a strange ripple ran across the water,
and the fifth and sixth steps were clearly on top of it.
“Ooooh,” Asuna and I said, marveling.
The knight turned and beckoned us forward. “Come, you two. Step
slowly onto the water.”
We bobbed our heads and proceeded to the lapping edge of the
lake. Just to be sure, I grabbed my partner’s shoulder and held her
still.
“So, Kizmel, if we walk on the surface of the water, the starfish won’t
appear?”
“I guarantee it. However…”
“However?”
“The Droplets of Villi charm on your boots will only take effect when
stepping softly. If you run or leap, you will break the surface and lose
the effect. Then the starfish will notice you…so do take care not to
lose your cool.”
I got the feeling that last part was directed solely at me but decided
it was just my imagination. The bigger question was whether or not
we could entrust our lives to magic—er, a “charm”—that could lose
its effect just by running. After all, Ophiometus’s body never
surfaced. It only sent its long, long hands up to grab players and drag
them down, so it was impossible to beat by fighting. And unlike in
the beta, if we died on the lake floor, we would not be respawning in
Blackiron Palace in the Town of Beginnings.

37|P

I wanted to say Kizmel, we really can’t afford to die but caught
myself. That statement was just as true of NPCs like Kizmel as it was
to us. Even if another dark elf with the same name and appearance
was generated in the forests of the third floor after her death, it
would not be the same Kizmel. How could I possibly say to her “It’s
all right if you die, but we’re more important”?
“It’s okay, Kirito,” whispered Asuna, seemingly reading my mind. She
reached out to grab the fingers of my right hand and murmured,
“We just have to walk. And even if we do fall, I have an ace up my
sleeve. Or up my pant leg.”
“Your…pant leg…?”
I had no idea what the fencer was insinuating, but it didn’t seem like
it should be that hard to do this without running or jumping. At the
very least, it should be way more manageable than maneuvering the
difference between walking and jumping in a traditional video game,
where the only distinction was in the exact angle your thumb tilted
an analog stick.
“…Well, all right. Just be careful and keep what you’re doing in mind
at all times.”
“Speak for yourself,” she shot back, and we stepped forward. At first,
our shoes just splashed the water, but soon there was buoyancy
underfoot. We stood atop the water, which felt like stepping on a
thick layer of rubber.
Once we reached Kizmel, who had been patiently waiting, she
favored us with a reassuring smile and turned away. Then she started
splashing atop the water for the far bank. We followed.
Once we’d walked about twenty meters out, Asuna said, “Oh
yeah…when we fought Wythege the Hippocampus on the fourth
floor, was this charm the reason that Viscount Yofilis didn’t sink into
the water?”
38|P

“Ohhh…But hang on, wasn’t he running like crazy over the surface?”
“Asuna’s guess is half correct,” Kizmel said, turning her head just
over her shoulder to look at us. “The liquid I dripped on the soles of
our shoes is a valuable elixir that can only be made by villi—water
spirits, undine maidens. But Viscount Yofilis’s shoes are woven with
villi hair and will never sink into the water.”
“Hair…? Y-you don’t mean that he killed the spirit and chopped off its
hair, right…?” I asked, envisioning some tragic drama, but Kizmel
vehemently shook her head.
“Never!”
A bit of water splashed at her feet, and the knight hunched her neck.
Fortunately, it was not enough to break the charm itself, and she
resumed quietly, “To us elves, the undines, including the villi, are just
as sacred as the dryads of the forest. They are our neighbors and our
protectors…If we consider cutting down a living tree or despoiling a
clear brook as breaking taboo, then killing a villi herself would be
calling down a curse upon all elfkind.”
“I-I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have suggested such a thing…But then, how
did the viscount get such valuable shoes?”
Price was an unknown value in this case, but fantasy RPGs always
treated equipment for feather-falling and water-walking as precious
artifacts. By this point, we were near the center of the lake, and the
titanic, deadly starfish lurked just a few meters below us, but I was so
absorbed by this topic that I nearly forgot it as I awaited her answer.
Kizmel faced forward and shook her head again, almost
imperceptibly this time. She whispered, “I do not know the details.
But if rumor is to be believed…in the long-distant past, the viscount
and a villi maiden…no. I should not speak of uncertain things. Please
pretend you did not hear this.”

39|P

Asuna, who was about a thousand times more interested than me in
that sort of topic, sighed. But she did not persist—and held her
silence as she walked.
I couldn’t help but wonder if the blade scar on the viscount’s face
might have something to do with this story, but there was probably
no way of ever knowing that. At the very least, Yofilis’s waterwalking boots were not meant to go to any player, so I could give the
idea up for lost.
Up ahead, the far bank that started off hazy in the distance was
coming much closer. We had maybe two hundred meters to go, and
its white beach and the looming rock wall behind it were clearly
visible.
Of the five areas that made up the sixth floor, the first area in the
northeast, containing the main town, was forest; the second area in
the northwest, containing Castle Galey, was barren wasteland; the
third area to the west was swampland; and the fourth area to the
south, where we were currently heading, was designed to be caves.
It was not a man-made dungeon, but a natural cavern formation, and
there were few places where you could actually see the sky—or the
bottom of the seventh floor, as the case may be. So it was not
necessarily a fun strolling place, but it was certainly better than the
western area we were skipping, with its muddy slog and deep sludge
just off the beaten path.
Once we got the sacred key, we had to return to Castle Galey, but
having the lake shortcut would be a huge help when it came time to
tackle the floor’s labyrinth, if we could make use of it. But these
Droplets of Villi were clearly extremely valuable, so I couldn’t just ask
her for more—not when it was mere convenience’s sake.
In the meantime, the far bank was growing close, and the view under
the surface was clearer again, with little schools of fish swimming
underfoot. At times, there were glints of what looked like coins or
40|P

jewels in the sand down there, which made me want to reach in and
grab them, but that was clearly a trap. I’d have to wait until we had a
means of defeating the starfish first.
Our usual pattern of activity called for one of the two of us—usually
me—to screw up and get into major trouble just before we reached
safety, but there were no sudden splashes into the water this time.
We stood on firm ground again, walked up the white beach a ways,
then came to a stop with a sigh of relief.
“Well…there’s a first for everything. That was rather exhilarating,”
the knight said.
I turned to her in surprise. “Wait, that was your first time walking
across the lake, too, Kizmel?”
“But of course. I have never even set foot outside of Castle Galey
here.”
“Then you’re saying…you don’t know the location of the
underground maze that holds the key…?” I asked, thinking this might
be the rare occasion when we led Kizmel around instead of the
reverse. But the knight took a scroll of parchment out of the long,
thin case on her belt and said proudly, “I have not been there, but I
know the way. See?”
I peered at the paper. It was a map of the southern area drawn in
considerable detail. A red mark was placed within the twisting cave
complex, and a red line indicated the route there directly from the
lakeside.
“Oh, so you do have a map. So this is the lake, and this is our
destination…and what’s this mark for? It looks like an insect head,”
Asuna said, pointing at a spot near the bottom of the map.
“That’s correct,” Kizmel replied with a nod. “Lurking in the caverns is
a giant centipede covered in rocky armor. Fortunately, we need not

41|P

cross its path, but I hear tell of many humans who have wandered
into its lair and paid the ultimate price.”
“Sheesh…Starfish, centipedes—this place has everything. I just hope
there are no millipedes or ganymedes.”
I could have been a snob and pointed out that the last one was the
name of a moon, not a creature, but I kept it to myself.
In the beta, there wasn’t a centipede-type field boss in the southern
area of the sixth floor. Instead, there was a plant boss in the
labyrinth tower located in the fifth and final area, and the
unbeatable starfish in the lake, but that was all I remembered.
Some of the field bosses had been changed in previous floors—like
the giant tortoise boss on the fourth floor becoming a two-headed
sea turtle—but there were no newly added bosses so far. The
advancement group was tackling the game under that premise, so if
the ALS or DKB, in their competitive haste, ran into a centipede boss
in the cave that they weren’t prepared for, there was the possibility
for disaster lurking ahead.
“Sorry, give me a moment,” I asked the two women, who were still
examining the map, and went to the MESSAGES tab of my main
menu. I fired off a brief message to Argo the information dealer.
WHERE’S THE FARTHEST FR NOW?
FR was shorthand for front-runner, Argo’s preferred nickname for
the group pushing us ahead into Aincrad. She must not have been in
combat or spying, because I got a response within ten seconds.
THEY’LL BE TRYING THE DUNGEON LEADING INTO THE THIRD AREA
TONIGHT. 100C, her message said, with the cost of the information
indicated at the end. Fortunately, she kept a running tab for me, but
the bill wasn’t what made me grimace.

42|P

“Too fast,” I muttered, checking the MAP tab. The lead group moved
from the first area to the second yesterday afternoon, January 2, so
they were moving on to the next area after just a single day.
The second area had just one small town by the name of Ararro—the
dark elves’ Castle Galey was meaningless if you weren’t doing the
“Elf War” quest—and the monsters outside of the ones in the dry
valley leading to the castle weren’t that tough. So I figured it
wouldn’t take them long, but this was still very quick. Most likely,
Kibaou and Lind calculated they could take one area per day,
finishing the sixth floor in just five days total. Given that we had
finished the fifth floor in four days, it wasn’t outrageous, but the last
labyrinth tower was on a straight line if you avoided detours. This
one required far more travel to reach.
At any rate, it was clear that we needed to assume the swampy third
area would be finished by tomorrow afternoon, at which point the
front-line group would reach this, the fourth area. I returned to
Kizmel’s side to examine the map; the giant centipede’s lair was
located a bit before Cave City of Goskai, the biggest town in the area.
If the group was rushing along the path, tired after clearing out the
dungeon passageway, there was a greater chance of them stumbling
across the centipede’s cave with little or no preparation than I
wanted to admit.
I opened my window again and sent a second message to Argo.
GOT INTEL ON A NEW FIELD BOSS LOCATED BEFORE GOSKAI IN THE
FOURTH AREA.
GOT IT, she immediately wrote back, I’LL WIPE OUT THE COST OF
YOUR LAST TIP.
That should be enough to keep the DKB and ALS from running across
the centipede boss without a clue that it was coming. However, not

43|P

that I didn’t trust them to hold their own, but I wanted to take part
in that boss battle, too.
The real question was, could we finish up the “Castle Galey” quest by
tomorrow afternoon and catch up with the group again?
“That charm of Far Scribing you humans can use is a very handy
thing,” said Kizmel, impressed. She’d been watching me send
messages to Argo.
Asuna piped up to say, “The elves have to send scouts to hand over
letters, don’t you? Even with your spirit trees, that seems like a lot of
hard work.”
“That is right. We dark elves and forest elves have thought little of
your human charms, but seeing what you are capable of doing, I
suspect that your Mystic Scribing and Far Scribing alone might
surpass all the magic we elves still possess.”
I wasn’t quite sure how to respond to her. She recognized them as a
form of magic, but the player menu and instant messages were game
features, and I couldn’t very well explain that. Also, that human
players could use that “magic,” but NPC humans could not.
But Kizmel didn’t show any further interest in the art of Far Scribing.
Instead, she brought up a point I hadn’t thought about in a while.
“What was it that N’ltzahh the fallen elf said on the fourth floor?
When they have all the keys and open the door to the Sanctuary, the
greatest magic of humankind will vanish, correct?”
“Oh…he did say that,” said Asuna, her cheeks flushing a little bit. I
wondered why and tried to recall the circumstances of that scene.
We had taken a gondola trip down the river out of Rovia on the
fourth floor and were at the very end of the watery dungeon when
the two of us overheard the Fallen having a discussion.

44|P

In addition to N’ltzahh, the masked general, there was also Eddhu, a
foreman, and a woman elf who seemed to be the general’s aide. The
statement was from N’ltzahh to his aide, whose name I recalled
being Kysarah.
Once we have all the keys and open the door to the Sanctuary, even
the greatest magic left to humankind will vanish without a trace.
And in response, Kysarah had said Of course, Excellency. The
moment of our triumph grows ever closer.
If we couldn’t use our Mystic Scribing and Far Scribing anymore, that
would be a huge deal. But it seemed impossible in a practical sense.
Instant messages were one thing, but not being able to use the main
game menu? No choosing skills, storing items away, or viewing the
map—the game would be impossible to beat that way.
So did that mean the “greatest magic” N’ltzahh spoke of was
something else? Something the loss of which would tie in to some
great wish of the fallen elves? What kind of desire would that
actually be…?
My imagination ran into a brick wall at that point. My right hand
opened and clenched repeatedly in frustration. Then Asuna came
marching over to me and stepped on my left foot with the toe of her
boot, hard.
That sensation was the trigger that brought forth a new flood of
memories. When N’ltzahh had said those things, Asuna and I had
been hiding in a small wooden box, squashed and immobile. My
hand had gotten stuck under Asuna’s breastplate, and…
“I believe we’ve had enough of a rest. I’d like to finish and return to
the castle while it’s light out,” announced Kizmel, pulling me out of
my flashback. I lowered my hand and silently shook my head at
Asuna. She snorted and gave me a glance that ordered me to erase
that memory forever, then began walking alongside the knight.

45|P

There was a tall rock face before them, with a yawning cave mouth in
the center.
Say, the harassment-prevention code didn’t go off that time,
either…I thought as I hurried after them. I wonder if she saw the
window for it open when she woke up this morning?
The majority of the cave area was not pitch-black like an interior
dungeon; instead, open areas here and there allowed light in from
the ceiling, and even at its gloomiest, there was still enough natural
light to see by. We didn’t need to carry torches or lanterns.
Fortunately, the monsters here were not insects but primarily bat
and aquatic types. The most troublesome were the slimes, making
their first appearance in Aincrad here. Japanese RPGs were famous
for characterizing slimes as the weakest intro monsters, but that was
not true in SAO at all. For one thing, there was no fire or ice magic in
the world to effectively counter that jiggly slime body.
So we’d have to make do with our weapons. Even then, slashing and
thrusting attacks were weak against the slime, with only blunt
weapons having any decent effect. And for our party of three, Kizmel
and I had slashing weapons, and Asuna used a thrusting weapon.
Slimes were uniquely tough for us.
So…
“Aaaaargh! Jeeeez!”
Asuna made no attempt to hide her frustration as she activated the
sword skill Oblique. Her rapier lit up the dim surroundings with a
lightning-fast downward thrust. It struck the brown-colored
Covetous Ooze on the cave floor before her.
A large hole appeared in the center of the roughly one-meter-wide
slime, and while it looked as though it might be spraying apart to
pieces, there wasn’t much effect on its HP. When the visual effects of

46|P

the skill faded, the bits of ooze squirmed back together to take their
original flat, jiggly form.
I noticed that a part of it was bulging outward, so I warned Asuna,
“Take evasion!”
The fencer leaped away when she was able to move, just as the
bulging part of the ooze emitted a little whiplike tentacle. It tried to
snake around the Chivalric Rapier but closed on air by mere
centimeters when Asuna pulled her weapon back.
If it caught hold, it would yank with tremendous force, and if pulled
free, the weapon would be absorbed into the slime’s center mass.
That made it difficult to retrieve, and the weapon suffered major
durability loss in the meantime. Even I didn’t know what might
happen if it grabbed the player, and they were wearing, say, cloth
armor.
The Covetous Ooze—so named for the way it greedily stole things—
retracted its tentacle and wobbled, practically mocking Asuna.
“Grrrr! What do we do about this thing, Kirito?!” she pleaded. I
glanced behind me, where a few meters away, Kizmel was dealing
with two vampire bats. Her HP hadn’t dropped at all, so she was
probably fine on her own. I looked back to Asuna and said, at a safe
volume that wouldn’t call down more nearby monsters, “First, guide
it into the light!”
“I…I’ll try!”
Asuna slowly moved back to her right, until the jiggling ooze followed
into a ring of natural light coming through a hole in the ceiling. The
dirty yellow-brown body in the darkness turned a brilliant gold in the
light—but that was it. It didn’t take any damage from the light or
seem distressed or try to run away from it.
“…Nothing happened!” Asuna wailed, so I gave her the next hint.

47|P

“Look closely at the slime’s whole body while it’s translucent in the
sunlight!”
“Huh?! Oh…there’s something there.”
As sharp as ever, Asuna found what she was looking for in just two
seconds of squinting. Not in the center of the ooze but along the
outer edge of what constituted its “legs,” there was something shiny
and reflective, like an eyeball, or a fish-egg pouch, or one of those
clear raindrop cakes.
“That’s the slime’s core! Crush that little thing with a sword skill, and
you’ll kill it in one blow!” I shouted. As if on cue, the ooze curled
itself inward into a ball shape. It wasn’t frightened, but it was tensing
itself to jump high off the ground, where it spread itself out thin and
wide. If it wrapped itself around your head, you’d take continuous
acidic damage and start to suffocate.
But instead of backing away, Asuna used another sword skill. It was
even easier to see the core with the slime’s body all spread out in the
sun, making it the perfect target for the single thrust skill, Streak. The
tip of her rapier left a silver streak as it struck the two-centimeterwide core. The translucent sphere resisted for a brief moment before
it burst with a little popping sound.
When its HP reached zero, the slime lost its internal cohesion and
flew apart into many tiny bits. They splattered against the fencer’s
face and body, covering her in dark-yellow jelly. She probably would
have shrieked, if not for the fact that the ooze turned into little blue
polygonal textures that drifted away.
Asuna stood there, rapier still outstretched, until Kizmel returned
from dispatching the two bats and said cheerily, “Ah, well done,
Asuna. Not many elves are skilled enough to defeat a slime with a
single rapier thrust.”

48|P

“…Thank you…” the young woman muttered. Were her lips twitching
because some of the ooze had flown into her mouth? I was quickly
becoming a master of the most freakish foods of Aincrad and wanted
to ask her how it tasted, but my survival instincts told me now was
not the time.
I wanted to say “Nice job!” with a smile instead but had to hold off
on that, too. There were more faint sounds of jiggling and wobbling
in the distance. I put a finger to my lips to hush the other two and
listened closely. The unique sound of slime wriggling was getting
closer and louder, but I saw no cursor around. When that happened
in the beta, it was usually because…
“Above!” I shouted.
Overhead, an amorphous shape was dropping down from between
thin, icicle-like stalactites on the ceiling of the cave.
Asuna noticed it belatedly and tried to jump back as she watched it
fall, but she unluckily tripped over a low stalagmite that was directly
behind her and fell flat on her bottom. Kizmel raised her saber to
protect Asuna, but if she simply slashed at the falling slime and didn’t
happen to strike the core on the way through it, the liquid creature
would take little damage and attack the two of them directly.
I lifted up my sword on pure instinct to queue up the sword skill
Sonic Leap. I would jump up at as hard an angle as the system would
allow and strike the falling slime with it. Because it was just off the
hole in the ceiling, the slime didn’t catch the sun, and it only looked
like a dark smudge. There was no way to tell where the core was at
this point.

49|P

50|P

But I kept my eyes as wide as I could and smashed the amorphous
creature with my Sword of Eventide +3. Normally, I would take the
power boost of adding my own swing to the system’s autoassistance, but this time, I purposefully slowed it down just enough
to keep the sword skill from fumbling.
When the blade cut through the sticky substance, I felt it catching on
the denser little orb. Promptly, I stopped pulling back and let it
follow through, hearing the burst of the core shattering. The slime’s
HP were gone in an instant, the creature obliterated before I could
even read its name on the cursor. I’d get a good taste of its flavor if I
caught some flying jelly in my mouth, but a sudden premonition told
me to block my face with my arm. When I landed, all the pieces were
disintegrating into blue light.
It was quite an impressive feat, if I said so myself, so I turned with a
flourish and asked, “Are you two all right?” like a manga character.
For some reason, Asuna glared at me balefully from the floor.
“It…It got in my mouth again.”
“…What’d it taste like?” I asked, unable to fight my curiosity this
time. She said that the bits of Covetous Ooze tasted “hellishly sour,
like sour plums pickled in lemon juice.” The second one dropped an
item called Ooze Jelly, but I wasn’t the biggest fan of sour flavors and
decided to let it sit in my inventory to rot.
As soon as Asuna was back on her feet, she pressed me for answers.
“Kirito, I’m going to set aside the fact that you could have started by
telling me slimes have cores—and how to find them. When you cut
the second one, there was no light shining on the slime. Did you just
hit the core by getting lucky?”
“No way. I don’t have that kind of actual luck.” Even if I did, I would
have used it all up getting these two particular party members, putting
me well into the red to do so—a thought I kept to myself, of course.
51|P

“Natural light is the best way to find a slime’s core, like you just did,”
I explained, “but it also works with torches or lanterns in very dark
environments. But once you’ve hunted enough slimes to get the
hang of it, you learn how to find the core from other light sources,
too.”
“Other light…?” she repeated skeptically. But Kizmel suddenly
clapped her hands in epiphany. “Oh, of course! You can use the
flashing of your sword technique to illuminate the core.”
“Correct!” I said, giving her a round of applause. But then I paused. It
was a known fact that NPCs could use sword skills—but should I talk
about the “extracurricular” tricks involved in this case? Kizmel’s
expression of excitement and anticipation sealed the matter,
however. Asuna, meanwhile, looked skeptical.
“What? Sword skills give you less than a second between flashing
and landing on the target…Can you really find a slime’s core in that
amount of time?”
“Well, it comes down to experience…and slowing down the sword
skill. Slimes aren’t very mobile, so if you slow the skill down as much
as you can, it gives you more time to spot the core.”
“Slow it down…” Asuna muttered with equal parts wonder and
exasperation. She dropped her rapier back into its sheath. “I’ll
admit…I think that technique’s incredible, but it’s going to take me
quite a while to learn it, so for now, I’ll count on you to take care of
all the slimes in the dark.”
“Uh…s-sure thing,” I said, the only thing I could say.
Kizmel added, “Don’t worry, I will learn this skill as well.”
“Y-yeah…I’m looking forward to that,” I said, also the only thing I
could say.

52|P

After that, we saw not just the dark-yellow Covetous Ooze but blue
slimes, red slimes, and even some familiar-looking black slimes. As
she proclaimed, within three battles, Kizmel had effectively grasped
the trick of the so-called skill-lighting ability. From that point on, we
didn’t have much trouble reaching the entrance to the dungeon,
deep inside the cave, before lunch.
If possible, I was hoping to make the slight extra walk to the Cave
City of Goskai not too far off in order to eat and recover supplies, but
Kizmel wouldn’t want to venture into a human city, I assumed, and if
any players were there on the forest elf faction of the quest, they
would see Kizmel’s cursor transcend red straight into black.
So we sat down at the entrance to the dungeon, partaking in some of
the rations we got from Castle Galey. To my surprise, the baked treat
full of nuts and dried fruit was fantastically good. Even Asuna, the
snooty gourmet, seemed satisfied. Our spirit recovered, we then
plunged into the dungeon, tearing deeper and deeper into it, and
fighting an abruptly different set of monsters—until just after one
o’clock, when we ran into an obstacle I never imagined I would see.
“Huh…? This was a dungeon the elves built ages ago, right?” Asuna
murmured as she stared up at the thing. Kizmel’s head bobbed in
agreement.
“That is correct. According to legend, in the olden days just after the
Great Separation, the six keys were split across six floors and placed
within six different labyrinths to keep them hidden and safe.”
“Then why would that be there…?”
“………I do not know.”
Kizmel stepped forward and reached up to the square stone panel
that blocked the great doors before us, to touch the numbered
pieces lined up on it.

53|P

It was clearly a 15 puzzle—except that, in this case, they were lined
up six by six, so it was actually a 35 puzzle. At any rate, it was one of
those cursed puzzles found everywhere in Stachion.
Kizmel carefully clicked the tile next to the open space and turned
back to me. “This…is not anything made by the dark elves, or the
forest elves, either, I believe. Count Galeyon said nothing about
there being such a contraption in this labyrinth, either.”
“No…this one was created by humankind,” I said, which made Kizmel
wince.
“What…? Meaning, some human snuck into this labyrinth before us
and placed this device upon the door? Does that mean…the key’s
already been taken out…?”
“N-no, no, not necessarily. Besides, this puz—this seal might not
have been literally placed by the human who snuck in here…”
“What does that mean?” Kizmel asked suspiciously. Asuna and I
explained—with difficulty, because we couldn’t explain that these
were all “quests” in a “game”—the murder mystery in Stachion, and
the ensuing puzzle curse it had spawned.
The elf knight was silent for several moments when we were done
and finally said, “So the curse of this human lord being murdered ten
years ago has spilled out of the town of Stachion and has produced
this number puzzle on the door of this distant labyrinth?”
“Yep…that’s the only way to describe it at this point. Not that I think
old Pithagrus has any reason to curse an elf maze, specifically.”
“You never know. Curses are truly terrifying and unpredictable
things. Especially when they are curses set by the dead…The dark
elves have a number of stories about those unfortunate enough to
have come into contact with curses unrelated to them. To say
nothing of the famous tale of how the wicked dragon Shmargor

54|P

came under the Holy Tree’s curse and tormented the humans who
did nothing to it.”
“Ah yes…You do have a point…”
In a sense, the entire floating castle of Aincrad was like the curse of
the mad genius, Akihiko Kayaba. And we were the ones unfairly
trapped inside it…although, as a beta tester as well, I suppose it was
inevitable that I would become a victim.
There was no point lamenting my plight at this point, however. All I
could do was trust that I would one day beat this deadly game—and
keep moving forward each day toward that goal.
Asuna’s gaze was distant, suggesting to me that she was thinking
much the same thing. Kizmel gave the two of us a glance, then
turned to the door again and said, “If this puzzle is the work of a
curse, then I suppose no sword can destroy it.”
“Huh…? Oh y-yeah, it’s indestructible.”
“Then we shall have to solve it,” the knight said simply.
I rushed to ask her, “H-hey, do dark elves solve puzzles, too?”
“Hmm? Well…as children, we solve picture-matching boards and
tangle rings, but I have never seen a puzzle of numbers like this. Are
we meant to reorder the boards in numerical order?”
“Yes, starting from the top left and moving in rows,” I explained,
though on the inside, I was starting to panic.
One of these sliding puzzles with fifteen pieces was hard enough if
you didn’t know the trick, but this one had thirty-five to deal with. I
figured it would be too tough for Kizmel at her first shot—and that
was without knowing if NPCs had the AI power to solve puzzles like
this. From what I recalled, N × N grid puzzles like this one were called
NP-hard problems in computational theory, meaning that normal

55|P

computers found it difficult to compute the lowest number of moves
possible.
“Kizmel, maybe I should…” I started to say, but then my mouth hung
open.
After just three seconds of staring at the randomly placed numbers,
Kizmel was now tearing through them. The rapid clicking of tiles
sliding into place filled the dark corridor, and before my eyes, the
thirty-five tiles began to line up in order from the top left. To our
shock, soon the thirty-fifth and final tile snapped into place.
The entire stone board momentarily glowed, and the door behind it
slowly rumbled open. Kizmel looked over her shoulder at us and
grinned.
“Ah, I see now. Your human puzzles are quite refreshing.”
It was virtually a direct path through once the door was open, with
hardly any monsters inside, so we reached the final room quickly. It
was the same key-dungeon boss as on the fifth floor, a headless
dullahan, but much stronger. Fortunately, we’d leveled up, too, and
Kizmel’s presence was positively unfair, so while we did make use of
the healing potions from Castle Galey, the fight was won with little
difficulty.
In the rear of the boss chamber was a stately little shrine. Resting on
the altar in the middle of it was a pitch-black object—the Agate Key.
Recovering it was pretty much the end of the mission. There was no
teleportation in SAO aside from the gates and crystals, so without a
means of fast travel, we had no choice but to return to Castle Galey
on foot. It helped to know that this just meant more time together
with Kizmel.
We returned to the entrance of the dungeon in half the time and
made our way out of the caves altogether, avoiding slimes wherever
we could. At last, the brilliant blue of Lake Talpha greeted us back.
56|P

After a brief break on the monster-less beach, we walked back across
the lake and returned to the northwest area.
There were no fallen elf ambushes on the road back this time across
the wasteland—but no fruiting cacti, either. Kizmel sheltered herself
under the Holy Tree cape again, and we protected her through the
dusty canyon. By the time the great gate of Castle Galey came into
view again, the bottom of the floor above us was dyed the colors of
sunset.
As we walked through the gate, accompanied by the ringing of bells,
I checked the time in my game window. It was 4:20 PM. Sadly, we’d
missed the period that the old storyteller would be in the library, but
for a major floor-spanning quest like that, it was very good time. I
stretched, feeling the pleasant ache of fatigue, and Kizmel slapped
me on the back with a smile.
“Nice work today…but there’s more of it yet to do. We must deliver
the key we recovered to Count Galeyon.”
“Oh…yes, that’s right,” I said, but in all honesty, I wasn’t in the mood
to rush off to see the count just now, and I didn’t think Asuna was,
either. Once we delivered the key and completed the quest, Kizmel
was probably going to use that spirit tree to leave for the seventh
floor this time.
The royal city where the dark elf queen lived was on the ninth floor.
That was where the “Elf War” questline would reach its grand finale.
It felt like such a long way to go when we started the quest on the
third floor, but here we were, about to cross the halfway point.
After the campaign was over, I had no idea what would happen to
Kizmel and us. Perhaps we could see her whenever we went back to
the royal city, or perhaps not. But at the very least, I felt certain we
would never fight side by side with her again. Kizmel was just too

57|P

strong for me to optimistically imagine that we would be allowed to
take her along on totally unrelated quests and grinding sessions.
“Um…Kizmel,” Asuna said, speaking in my stead, “when we give the
count the key, are you going to leave for the next floor?”
She was a hundred times more honest with herself than I was. The
elf knight appeared to be holding something back—or so it seemed
to me, trick of the eyes or not—but put on her usual pleasant smile
soon enough.
“That’s a good question…It depends on the determination of the
priests sent from the royal city. Most likely, I will be ordered to
deliver the four keys to the fortress on the seventh floor.”
“I see…It’s a very important mission, after all…” Asuna murmured,
looking up at the spirit tree ahead of us. Then she turned to the
knight, took a big step forward, and asked in hushed tones, “But in
that case, why does it have to be just you who goes around gathering
these keys? We’ve gotten four of the six back…Why can’t the knights
from the castle or those darn priests themselves go and get the last
two?”
“I don’t think of this mission as being difficult or unpleasant.” Kizmel
grinned. She stroked Asuna’s chestnut-brown hair lovingly, like an
older sister would. “As Her Majesty’s knight, I have a duty to uphold,
and I have you two helping me…Sometimes I wish it was not six keys,
but ten or twenty instead.”
“……Kizmel…”
Asuna hunched over, looking ready to cry. Kizmel moved her hand to
the girl’s back and beckoned me over with the other. She offered
quietly, “Also, in the background of this mission are a host of
troublesome political calculations and squabbles. As I told you a
while ago, my Pagoda Knights Brigade, the palace security
Sandalwood Knights Brigade, and the heavily armored Trifoliate
58|P

Knights Brigade are often at odds…Our leadership, especially, has
always been competitive with one another. When the word came
that the forest elves were going after the hidden keys, there was
considerable argument over which brigade should respond…”
“And they weren’t trying to foist off the responsibility on one
another, but just the opposite, of course,” I conjectured.
Kizmel nodded seriously. “That is correct. It has been over a century
since knights of Lyusula left the castle for a practical mission, rather
than training…and against the forest elves of Kales’Oh, no less. The
three brigades fought for the honor of this duty, and ultimately, it
was given solely to the Pagoda Knights Brigade, for our light armor
and fleet movement. A vanguard of sixty was sent down to the third
floor, but there is no dark elf fortress there. We were to build a camp
for our base and scout the labyrinth that contained the key. There
was not supposed to be any combat…”
She exhaled heavily. I knew where the story went from that point
and wanted to tell her she didn’t need to bother, but I was too late
to interrupt.
“…But on our first scouting mission, which split the vanguard into
two groups, we suffered a forest elf ambush. The scout group was
virtually wiped out by an attack from the rear, and that was when
Tilnel lost her life. The commander of the vanguard requested more
members from the brigade’s headquarters, of course…but the
request was refused. They probably knew that if it was revealed that
the group freshly descended to the third floor was already half gone,
the other brigades would swoop in to steal our glory…”
“No…! You fought as hard as you could! They can’t just…” Asuna
started to shout. Kizmel glanced around and led us to a bench placed
along the wall of the castle. She sat between Asuna and me, crossed
her fingers over her stomach, and looked up at the spirit tree
looming over the open courtyard.
59|P

“We fought hard…” she repeated peacefully. “That is correct. But
fighting hard, by itself, is not enough when you are the queen’s
knight. When you fight, you must win…so I do not curse our
headquarters for refusing our request. If anything, I am grateful that
they allowed me the opportunity to regain my honor.”
But Asuna didn’t seem fully convinced by that answer. She balled her
fists where they rested atop her knees, and her head pointed
downward.
“…But…that doesn’t mean…you need to do this…all on your own…”
“Asuna, it is true that I alone am on the mission to retrieve the keys,
but that is not because the other knights are sitting around, doing
nothing. The vanguard’s commander put together a new plan to
complete our mission with a much smaller number. About ten
knights would take turns harrying the forest elves and drawing their
attention; meanwhile, one knight skilled in stealthy matters would
get the keys from the labyrinths…I nominated myself for the
retrieval. Tilnel and I played tag and hide-and-seek in our youth, so I
am confident in my sneaking.”
I wonder, when elves play tag, and they envision “it” as being a
monster, what do they think of? Probably an ogre type… I considered
this briefly before snapping back to attention.
I remembered how Kizmel said she elected to do the mission alone,
when we stood before Tilnel’s makeshift grave at the third-floor
camp. Diversion, infiltration—it was a very skillful plan, I was sure,
but one that exposed Kizmel to great danger. She got the key on the
third floor safely, but the elite Forest Elven Hallowed Knight gave
chase, and they nearly killed one another in the ensuing duel.
Before her sister’s grave, Kizmel told me she took on that mission
expecting that she could very well die. That a part of her might have
even wanted to.

60|P

But looking at her peaceful smile in profile now, I could no longer see
the deep sadness I witnessed in that lonely moment. I turned to the
left, looking past the knight to my partner, who was still clenching
her fists.
“Asuna, Kizmel’s mission is a very tough one. But she’s not doing it
alone…She’s got us helping her out.”
“Yes, that’s right. That’s exactly right,” Kizmel said, nodding deeply.
She caressed Asuna’s head. “Since you and Kirito began helping me, I
have never thought of this mission as a painful one, and I have no
intention of dying without completing my task. We’ll recover all six
keys and go to the palace on the ninth floor together…I think you will
like it, Asuna.”
“………Yeah,” she squeaked, quiet but firm, placing her head on
Kizmel’s shoulder.
We sat there on the bench in silence, watching as the color of
sunlight reflecting off the floor above grew darker and deeper with
the approach of the night.

61|P

WITH OUR REPORT TO COUNT GALEYON, THE “AGATE Key” quest
was over. Asuna and I received a huge amount of experience, and as
on the fourth floor, we had our choice of item rewards.
That was fantastic, of course, but what made us even happier was
learning that Kizmel was given a full day of downtime. She could do
whatever she wanted tomorrow, January 4, and she didn’t need to
go to the seventh floor until the morning of the fifth. I was still
worried about the front-line group reaching the south area by
tomorrow afternoon, but I did pass along the info about that new
centipede boss through Argo, so I didn’t think there was any danger
of them fighting it unprepared.
We had to take part in the labyrinth tower and floor-boss fight, of
course, but if Kizmel gave us more of those Droplets of Villi, we could
go straight from the second area to the fifth one. And if not, we
could still probably catch up with the group using the normal route in
about half a day, assuming the pathway dungeons had been cleared
out. I said as much to Asuna after we returned to the room on the
third floor of the west wing, and we agreed that we would spend
tomorrow taking it easy.
When we returned to the hallway to meet Kizmel, we went to the
basement bath to wash off the imaginary sweat and grime of the
day. In order to avoid repeating yesterday’s tragedy, we agreed
beforehand to keep each half of the bathing area separate between
the sexes. But hearing the two women chatting and laughing on the
other side of the spirit tree’s roots did not make the process any
easier for me.
When we were done bathing, we relaxed in the waiting area for a
while before heading to the dining hall. The main course today was
grilled fish. Not only did it not have the strangely spiced sauce that
62|P

the game’s human cooks liked to use, the fish’s skin was crispy and
fragrant, and I had to go ask for seconds.
We enjoyed some tea after the meal, chatting and reminiscing about
the events of the fourth and fifth floor. I left the dining hall feeling
extremely satisfied. Kizmel left briefly to return the Greenleaf Cape
to the treasure repository she’d borrowed it from, so Asuna and I
decided to explore the castle a bit. We started walking toward the
east wing, which we hadn’t seen yet in our time here.
Just then, there was a bell ringing in the darkened courtyard. We
stopped, noting with muted interest that they still rang the bells
after bathing and dinnertime…and then I recalled that this was not
actually a time for zoning out.
Hadn’t Kizmel said that the bell only rang when the south gate
opened…? And as a basic rule, the dark elves in the castle did not
leave it. The bell was alerting us to the fact that players aside from
ourselves had shown up at Castle Galey.
Asuna figured it out at the same time I did. We shared a look, then
dashed to a window. When we looked down at the courtyard,
pressed against the glass, we saw that the mammoth gates were
indeed very slowly opening.
My first thought was that this visitor was Morte or the dagger user,
or even both at once. Castle Galey was outside the safe-haven zone,
so nothing would stop them from coming in with criminal orange
cursors. All they needed to open the gates were the same Sigil of
Lyusula rings that we had. Last night, I surmised that it would be
difficult for them to get through the dark elf side of the campaign in
time, but there was no absolute evidence of that.
“We need to figure out who just showed up,” Asuna murmured, her
voice tense.

63|P

I pushed away my brief moment of indecision and said, “Yes, let’s go
down. Make sure you’re geared up.”
“Got it.”
We turned and started running for the stairs, both opening our game
menus. We switched from my indoor wear to my usual combat gear
and equipped our beloved weapons. I barely registered the steps as
we flew down to the first floor of the west wing. Rather than the
main doors to the castle, we rushed to a side door at the end of the
hallway and opened it a crack to peer out into the courtyard.
The bell was still ringing, but the front door was already in the
process of closing. If the visitor had already vanished into the
spacious castle, it would be very difficult to find them.
But even then, we could probably ask the soldiers near the door
what the player looked like. I steeled my courage and went into the
open, heading toward them along the sheer wall cut into the rock.
After about five steps, Asuna reached out and grabbed my collar. I let
out a strangled yelp and came to a stop.
“Wh-what was that for?” I whispered.
“Look, Kirito,” she whispered back, pointing in the direction of the
courtyard’s spirit tree, rather than the gate. As soon as I looked that
way, I blinked. There were four people gathered around the spirit
tree’s spring, their backs toward us. Their cursors were the very
same green as ours.
Based on their number, it probably wasn’t Morte’s group. And for
one thing, Morte and I had an official duel on the third floor, so our
names would display for each other, making one of those four
cursors read MORTE—but all I could see were HP bars and guild tags.
Kibaou’s Aincrad Liberation Squad had a tag of a gray sword and
shield on a green background. Lind’s Dragon Knights Brigade used a

64|P

silver dragon on a blue field. But this guild tag was neither of those; it
was an unfamiliar mark like the letter Q in gold against a black
background.
“…Have you seen that insignia before, Kirito?” Asuna whispered. I
shook my head.
“No. Do you…? Well, I guess you wouldn’t have asked if you did.”
She did not reply, but I sensed her head bobbing. The system had
confirmed that Morte was not among the four, and it didn’t seem
likely to me that the PK group led by the man in the black poncho
would form a guild and register it with such a distinct, memorable
logo—but it wasn’t confirmed yet that the two things were
unrelated. This castle was not a safe haven, so we had to be careful
at all times.
I was standing there, plastered against the rough rock face,
wondering what to do now, when Asuna whispered, “Hey. Let’s say
that some humans…er, players get into a fight inside the castle, and
their cursors go orange. How do you suppose the dark elves would
react? Would they ignore it, or…”
“Ummm…”
I didn’t have an immediate answer to that one. The reason that
orange (criminal) players couldn’t get into human towns with the
Anti-Criminal Code active wasn’t because of some magical barrier
that repelled anyone who was evil. It was because you’d get attacked
by tremendously powerful NPC guards. In the beta, there were
people who intentionally went orange, then stepped into town so
they could try to fight and defeat the guardians. They called
themselves Guardlers—apparently that was short for Guard Killers—
but unlike the sudokers in Stachion, from what I heard, no one had
succeeded by the end of the beta test.

65|P

Most likely, the dark elf soldiers in Castle Galey were not as unfairly
powerful as the guardians of the peace in player towns, but I felt like
they would not simply ignore humans running around with swords
inside their castle, either. I could say for certain that if those four
players attacked us, Kizmel at the least would come to our aid, and if
she ordered them to, the castle guards would get involved, too.
I condensed all that logic into a simple “I don’t think they’d ignore
the entire thing.”
Asuna agreed. “Exactly. So let’s just talk to them.”
“Yeah…I guess that’s the only real choice,” I admitted. Unless we
simply left the castle altogether, there was no way we could lurk
around the place without being spotted, and we had still too much to
do around here.
We walked away from the darkness of the wall, ready to draw our
swords if need be, toward the four players who still gazed at the
spring water before them. Neither of us was particularly trying to
hide our footsteps, but even within ten meters, none of the players
with their backs to us reacted at all. They were probably too
engrossed in their conversation.
“…You’d better not. You’ll get yelled at.”
“Yeah, but I at least wanna try it once. Nobody’s ever confirmed if
the blelfs are the only ones who can teleport from the spirit trees.”
“Fine, test it out, but if you vanish, we’re not going after you.”
“If the guards get mad, we’re running and leaving you behind.”
It sounded like the group was three men and one woman. Based on
the content of their conversation, they were definitely running the
campaign quest on the dark elf side. The term blelf was a mystery to
me, though.

66|P

We stopped two meters behind them, and they still didn’t notice, so
I sent Asuna a telepathic message to take it away and took a half
step back. Her look went from exasperated to ultra-sociable before
she called out pleasantly, “Good evening!”
The group of four was shocked, whirling around on the spot, but no
one reached for their weapons. They all stared at Asuna for about
five seconds, stunned, before their eyes traveled a bit higher. That
was probably a sign that they were examining her color cursor. Then
they looked at her again for three seconds, before finally noticing me
over her shoulder.
The first to speak was the woman, who used a large scimitar and
smallish buckler.
“G…good evening. I’m sorry—you startled us.”
“Oh no. I apologize for shouting like that out of nowhere,” Asuna said
with a smile, and the apprehension in the other party’s faces
instantly vanished. If I had spoken to them instead, it would have
taken ten times as long to get them to soften up.
“Wow, you really got me jumpy. I never expected to actually see
another player here.”
That was the small man with the two-handed sword who talked
about wanting to test the spirit tree’s teleportation earlier. Now he
was rubbing his breastplate instead. Next to him was a tall and
skinny fellow with a glaive, who shrugged.
“Of course there will be players here. The castle’s public.”
Last was a man with the odd combination of a tower shield thick as a
metal slab and a slender shortspear. He had a stubby beard and an
affable smile as he offered his hand.
“Hi there. We’re in a guild called Qusack. We’re going through the
blelf…er, dark elf campaign right now.”

67|P

So apparently, blelf was their nickname for dark elves. As Asuna and I
shook the shield man’s hand, I idly wondered what their nickname
for the forest elves was.
Then came the introductions. The scimitar woman, who seemed
smart and sensible, was Lazuli. The lackadaisical guy with the twohanded sword was Temuo. The rather sharp, tall glaive user was
Highston. Lastly, the hardy and bold shield bearer was Gindo.
I didn’t recognize any of their names—or the Qusack guild. Neither
did Asuna.
There were eight thousand players currently trapped on this floating
fortress, so of course nobody could memorize the names of them all.
In fact, I probably knew less than a hundred players by name. If we’d
crossed paths at one of the main towns on another floor, I wouldn’t
think twice about them, but Castle Galey was the wild frontier as of
January 3. They had to beat many of those nasty poisonous monsters
in the canyon on the way here, and they didn’t even have a full sixperson party. They had to be pretty close to us in level—so how was
it possible that I’d never even seen them before?
I almost wanted to be rude and ask if they definitely weren’t NPCs.
But another glance at their cursors revealed pristine green. While I
was on the mean streak, I glanced at their armor and attempted to
price it all. Two had light metal armor, and the other two had heavy;
and they all had the deep, rich shine of expensive quality. And
despite just having come through a deadly map to get here, their
gear looked fresh and unharmed, outside of Lazuli’s and Gindo’s
shields.
Perhaps they were players who didn’t burst out of the gate when the
game started two months ago but had the talent to catch up to the
front-line players afterward. If so, that was a heartening thought. It
seemed likely that the ALS would recruit them before too long, I
thought.
68|P

“Are you two doing the elf quest on your own?” asked Lazuli, the
scimitar girl, stepping forward. Her dark-green hair was tied into a
ponytail, and her proud features and husky but piercing voice gave
her an air of vitality and activity.
I gave Asuna another Take it away! psychic message. She looked at
me sidelong before smiling again and replying, “Yes, that’s right. We
just got to this castle yesterday, in fact.”
“Um…does that mean you’re in the advancing group?”
“W-well, technically…” Asuna shrugged.
Lazuli’s big eyes got even bigger. “Wow, I’ve never met one of them
before! And you’re so pretty! I can’t believe it.”
There was nothing but honest surprise and delight in her voice, but
for just a brief moment, the three men behind her shared an
uncomfortable look.
What was that about? I wondered instantly, but I couldn’t read their
minds from their expressions alone. After constantly being around
Asuna for so long, I was only just now starting to understand the way
she thought about things…possibly.
Asuna would have noticed the men’s reaction, too, but she
continued speaking with Lazuli without betraying any hint of
suspicion. She talked about how we were part of the front-line
group, but not in any guild, and Lazuli mentioned that the Qusack
four only left the Town of Beginnings four weeks ago. At that point,
Asuna suggested we continue talking in the dining hall.
The hungry adventurers immediately agreed, and we headed
through the entrance hall of Castle Galey to the second floor.
Kizmel’s task at the treasure repository would be done by now, but I
didn’t see her in the dining hall. In all honesty, I couldn’t anticipate
what might happen when she interacted with players other than us,

69|P

so I decided it wasn’t worth searching for her. The six of us sat down
at a table by a window.
A steward came over, so Asuna and I just asked for tea, while Gindo’s
group ordered the meal course plus bread—and they got seconds of
the fish, too. Only Highston the glaive user stuck to his one plate.
When he finished first, there was an apologetic look on his gaunt
face. “You’ll have to excuse them. We’re broke as a general rule, so
now that we’re here at the dark elf base, and the food is free, they
can’t help themselves.”
Temuo, whose head was shaved like a high school baseball player’s,
chomped down on a fish headfirst and butted Highston on the
shoulder. “Don’t act all smooth and in control in front of the pretty
girl! In the fifth-floor elf village, you were double fisting those
skewers!”
“And you had three in each hand!”
They were a jolly bunch. But once again, something about them
seemed off to me. Highston said they were broke, but they had very
expensive equipment. And if they had the skill to get this far—and
assuming they weren’t pouring their funds into sketchy items or
gambling—they should at least have enough col to spend on decent
food.
But obviously, I wasn’t going to pry into the financial situation of a
guild I’d just met, so I sat back and sipped my tea. Then, with the
most effortlessly natural smile and tone of voice imaginable, Asuna
asked, “So how do you all know each other?”
Considering that she was like a prickly hedgehog when we first met
at Tolbana on the first floor, Asuna’s transformed into quite the
pleasant socialite…
The thought sent a little snort out through my nose, rippling the
liquid in my teacup. Sensing my thoughts, the fencer gently stepped
70|P

on the top of my left foot, sending a very clear signal not to say
anything out of line.
Unaware that this act of intimidation was happening under the table,
the four exchanged another look, including Lazuli this time. Gindo
the bearded dandy—though of a different sort than Okotan from the
ALS—wiped his mouth politely with a napkin before responding.
“We met in the Town of Beginnings. But we never planned to
actually leave the town at first…We were more like an informationexchange fraternity.”
“Information exchange…?” Asuna repeated.
Gindo could sense the suspicion in her voice and explained, “I know
this will sound pathetic to you, given your place in the game, but the
‘waiters’ back in the Town of Beginnings who choose to stay safe
until the game is beaten still get hungry and sleepy every day. You
won’t die without food here, of course, and you can sleep on the
street, but everyone wants a hot meal and soft bed. That means you
need money for food and lodging each day.”
This was true. And though I hadn’t been back to the first floor in
quite a while, I knew that it was much harder than it sounded. The
quickest way to earn col was to beat monsters. SAO wasn’t the kind
of game that said “Bugs and animals wouldn’t be carrying gold
coins!” so even the weakling worms and boars right outside the
Town of Beginnings dropped a few col. Kill ten a day, and you could
afford a decent meal and a place to sleep—but even against boars,
there was no way to eliminate the possibility of an accident
happening.
Focus too much on one monster, and you might miss the sound of
another one popping into existence nearby and end up linking the
two in combat. Through repetition of little mistakes or lapses in
judgment like this, one gained knowledge, experience, and

71|P

ultimately, strength. But in this world, you had only one life that
could pay the price of a mistake. Most likely, the majority of the two
thousand players who’d already dropped out of the deadly game did
so not far from the Town of Beginnings. And according to Argo’s
rough calculations, that included a few hundred beta testers. One
mistake, one accident leading to panic, was all it took to deplete your
hit points, no matter how much you knew about the game…
“…But we didn’t earn our money by going out into the wilderness
and beating mobs. As a matter of fact, there are lots of quests in the
Town of Beginnings if you look for them,” Gindo said.
It was my turn to repeat his words. “Quests?”
“Yes. Of course, we couldn’t mess with the ones like ‘Go out of town
and get this thingy’ or ‘Beat X number of monsters,’ but within the
city, you can do stuff like errands, finding lost objects, and even
some rare ones like housecleaning and pet walking…”
“Oh, right, right!” said Lazuli, who was picking at the side of pickled
veggies that came with the grilled fish. “The one where you had to
clean up the hoarder house? That was a tough one…There were piles
and piles of items all throughout the house, and you had to separate
them into these huge wooden boxes out in the yard. You had to sort
every last item perfectly to beat the quest, and lots of them you
couldn’t really tell if they were toys, or practical items, or…”
“Did you know that if you pilfer the coins and jewels and stuff that
pop up in those piles, you get locked in the basement of that
mansion for like half a day?” Temuo added.
Highston sighed. “Only you would attempt something like that.”
The bickering made Asuna giggle. Their erstwhile leader, Gindo,
smiled wryly and spread his hands. “The point is, there are lots of
quests that give you safe earnings. But since they don’t endanger
your life, they’re all tedious instead. We started running into each
72|P

other so much at the various quest spots that we naturally got to
trading information.”
“That’s right. At first, I tried to keep my distance from this fishy old
guy,” said Lazuli, pointing her fork at Gindo. He whined, “I’m not that
old…”
Although his looks and manner were completely different, I saw a
similarity in Gindo’s gestures to the scimitar-wielding man named
Klein whom I’d spent a few hours hunting boars with on the first day
of the game.
He’d stayed behind in the Town of Beginnings to be with his friends.
Was he hard at work leveling up now, so he could reach the frontier?
Or was he staying put to focus on his safety? His name was still in my
friends list, so I could write him a message whenever I wanted, but
the last two months had passed without any communication
between us. I suppose I felt guilty about abandoning him and chose
not to draw attention to it by reaching out now.
Mentally speaking, the Town of Beginnings felt endlessly distant, but
with a teleportation gate, it was, in fact, just a step away. If we had
an opportunity to go to Stachion, maybe it would be nice to visit the
bottom floor again.
Just then, Lazuli said, “Still, as a general rule, there’s no downside to
the rewards when doing quests as a group. If you work together, you
get it done quicker, and you can use the extra time to search for
Japanese books to read. Pretty soon, our little info-trading group
became a cooperative strategy group.”
“Oh, I see…” murmured Asuna, who was satisfied with that answer.
She lifted the toe of her boot off my foot under the table.
It seemed perfectly natural that people would work together to clear
out city quests in the Town of Beginnings, but this was Castle Galey,
right on the frontier. There was a huge mental leap involved in going
73|P

from a group that banded together to avoid the danger of fighting
monsters to an official in-game guild—meaning they completed the
tricky and dangerous guild quest on the third floor—with fancy gear
that could knock out the scorpions in that dusty canyon on the way
to this castle.
Highston sensed my suspicion and turned to look me square in the
face, his long purplish hair waving.
“…Now that we’ve gotten to this part of the story, we might as well
see it through to the end. When we started the group, we were
making pretty solid income for a while…However, the Town of
Beginnings might be big, but it doesn’t have an endless supply of
quests. Some are daily quests that can only be done once a day, but
when the word got around about them, so many people tried them
that you had to wait half a day just to be able to undertake them…”
“Oh…that makes sense,” I said.
Gindo the bearded dandy picked it up from there. “The city quests
got picked clean before the first floor was cleared out, so we were in
trouble. Uh, not that I’m criticizing you folks in the front-line group—
just the opposite. We’re very grateful for your hard work, and we
feel bad that you’re doing all of this for our benefit. We couldn’t
even imagine trying what you do, clearing out labyrinths and beating
floor bosses…”
“Huh? That’s not true, though,” I said, a bit more blunt than I
probably needed to be. “You appear to have some high-grade gear,
and if you can get to this place, then I would imagine you can fight in
the labyrinth towers without too much trouble…”
I wanted to ask them if they’d help out by joining the raid group, but
all four suddenly began shaking their heads.
“No, no, no way—we can’t. We’re not like that…” Lazuli started to
protest, but Gindo cut her off.
74|P

“Let’s explain it in order. So, um…I told you how the quests in the
Town of Beginnings ran dry. Well, at that point, we had some decent
savings, so we weren’t going to go hungry anytime soon…but even
staying at the cheapest inn, that wallet was eventually going to
empty out. So the four of us talked it over and weighed two options:
Ration our money for as long as it can go in the safety of town? Or
blow it all out to buy gear and potions—and leave the town?”
“Huh…?”
If you had that option, you should’ve just picked it from the start, I
thought, before I realized something.
“Oh, right. If you beat quests, you get more than just money. You get
experience points.”
“’Zackly,” said Temuo, fish tail sticking out of his mouth. He worked
his lips to pull the rest of it inside and crunched away with a smile.
“By the time we beat all the interior quests in the Town of
Beginnings, we were all at level five.”
“Fi…?” I gaped. Asuna and I shared a look.
I left the town at level one after Akihiko Kayaba’s tutorial speech, but
I remembered that when I got the Anneal Blade at the town of
Horunka, I was still only level four. A team of four level-five players
with good gear would need a disastrous anti-miracle to lose to the
worm and boars around the starting town.
But the thing about MMORPGs was that the possibility of disaster
was always present. For players who’d stayed in the safety of town
for nearly a month to finally leave that safe zone, there had to be
some other motive that pushed them along.
“We did feel reassured that our levels were higher…but the reason I
argued we should go out into the world was a simpler one than
that,” said Highston shyly, holding his teacup with both hands. “I just
wanted to do more quests…SAO’s quests tend to be detailed, but
75|P

many also feel like they were written by a child. You just can’t tell
what’s going to happen in them. It feels like the moments when
we’re thinking hard about the clue that will solve the riddle, or
running around town looking for that one missing item, are the only
moments when we can actually forget we’re playing a game that’s
trying to kill us…”
“Huh?! Is that seriously what you were thinking?!” Lazuli yelped,
grumpily bopping Highston on the shoulder. The scowl turned into a
grin very soon, though. “You should have just said that instead! Then
we wouldn’t have had to argue and argue over it for all those hours.”
“Yeah. We all knew you were the biggest quest lover of the bunch
already,” Temuo pointed out. Highston flushed and tried to argue
that he wasn’t that obsessed.
Gindo smirked again at the way his companions bickered and got the
discussion back on track. “Anyway…we decided to use just about all
of our col to buy gear and went out of town. First, we went through
all the extermination and harvesting quests that we couldn’t do
before, then we all got to level 6 and earned a new skill slot. At that
point, I even started to think that at the rate we were going, we’d
catch up to the top group before too long…”
Suddenly, the smile left his lips, and he clenched his hands into fists.
“We finished all the quests in Horunka and Medai with ease, then
tried to take a shortcut through the swamp to Tolbana. In the week
since leaving town, we thought we’d gotten good at fighting, and the
kobolds around there were easy enough, so we got cocky. We came
across a group of three kobolds in the swamp and didn’t realize that
one was new to us…”
“Was it a Swamp Kobold Trapper?” I asked.
Gindo looked surprised but nodded. “Yes, I believe that was the
name. At the time, I used a one-handed sword, but the snare the

76|P

kobold threw tangled up my blade, and it fell into the swamp…I tried
to pick it up, but while I was reaching in the muck for it, another
kobold attacked me…”
“You didn’t read the strategy guide?” Asuna asked, her voice just a
little bit harder than before. “I’m pretty sure it was being distributed
for free in Medai by that point.”
“Oh…uh…”
Gindo turned uncomfortably to look at his friends, then sighed. “We
made use of it when leaving the Town of Beginnings, of course. It’s
just, those guides are mainly about monsters and items, and their
quest info is limited to the big ones and the combat ones…We were
proud—arrogant, even—about having completed all the quests in
the Town of Beginnings. We began thinking that we knew more than
the book did, so we only flipped briefly through the updated version
in Medai. And when we read it closely afterward, we saw that it had
a full breakdown of the Swamp Kobold Trapper and warnings about
the danger it posed…”
“…”
I opened my mouth to say something but realized I didn’t know what
I would actually say. The contents of Argo’s strategy guides naturally
skewed toward safety information. That was the reason she made
and distributed them in the first place, and she was going to need a
full writing staff to actually cover all the quests that didn’t have the
potential to be deadly.
“…At the time, I was close to dying, and Temuo and Lazuli were in
the yellow, too,” Gindo said, head downcast with shame. “I was in a
full-blown panic. I just wanted to run away, but it was a swamp, so
running was hard…All I knew was that I was going to die. We ran and
ran like people possessed and finally threw them off, but at that
point, our spirit was broken…”

77|P

I’d been fighting at the front line of player progress since SAO
officially launched, but the number of times I’d felt the Grim Reaper
reaching for my neck was surprisingly few. But I understood exactly
what he meant when he spoke of broken spirits. I still felt a vivid chill
run down my spine when I recalled that moment fighting Asterios
the Taurus King on the second floor, when I’d been paralyzed after
his lightning attack, helpless to do anything but to look up at the
approaching boss.
The fact that I didn’t drop out of the advancing group and hide in the
safety of town after that was probably because I was with Asuna, I
supposed. She would say something like “I’d rather die than give up,”
and I couldn’t possibly leave her to her own devices and return to
the Town of Beginnings.
I imagined that these four had probably stuck through it because of
their personal bonds.
Meanwhile, Gindo continued, “When we returned to Medai,
battered and broken, there were about ten players in the town
square shouting about something. When we asked what happened,
they said that the first-floor boss had been beaten while we were out
adventuring. That was exciting and wonderful, and we were grateful
to the players who did it, but we honestly felt conflicted.”
Gindo sighed, and the close-shaven Temuo stepped in. “It’s like,
there we were, defeated and miserable, and then we hear that
news? It just pointed out how unfit we were…Like, I played in a
youth baseball league until middle school…”
“Huh?!” I yelped. Only half of that was surprise that he was actually a
baseball player like I’d imagined, and the other half was that he
willingly divulged real-world details about himself to strangers.
Temuo seemed surprised by the reaction, but Highston shook his
head in annoyance.

78|P

“We always tell you, don’t dredge up talk of the outside.”
“So what? I can talk about my own life if I want to. Right?” he asked,
turning to me for validation. I awkwardly agreed.
“Er, uh, yeah.”
“See, in baseball, it’s really easy to tell when you’re outclassed. It’s
true of all sports, of course…but there’s always at least one guy on
your team that you realize you’ll never be better than, and when you
play in a tournament, you find monsters that even he can’t overcome
in competition. Only the people who keep at it and don’t let that
discourage them will reach the top, but I couldn’t hack it. When I
heard the boss was beaten, I remembered that feeling again. That
feeling of being in the stands at the park, yelling myself hoarse, and
sensing just how far away it all felt…”
He trailed off, his eyes gazing into space. It was like he was watching
the heat haze over the baseball field in midsummer.
As someone who was actually present at the battle against Illfang the
Kobold Lord, the first-floor boss, I should’ve said something, but I
couldn’t find the words. Temuo was talking about being outclassed
and feeling like we were so distant, but I didn’t share that sensation
at all. The only thing that defined the current front-line group was a
successful sprint off the starting line, nothing else. None of the floor
bosses had been easy. When they were in Medai marveling at our
victory over Illfang, we were mourning the loss of Diavel, our raid
party leader.
“So…why didn’t you go back to town after that?” Asuna asked,
wasting no breath.
Temuo blinked a few times at how direct her question was.
“Well, if I had to use a single word, I guess it was…stubbornness?” He
looked to his sides, where Lazuli, Highston, and Gindo all nodded.
“We knew that we weren’t going to get into the frontier group…but
79|P

we were still stubborn in thinking that we knew more about quests
than anyone else. So we said to ourselves, before we give up and run
back to the safe zone, let’s test out how far we can get with quests
alone.”
“Q-quests alone…?” I asked, while next to me, Asuna gasped.
“Oh! Does that mean the Q from Qusack is for…?”
“Yep! Very astute, Asuna!” Lazuli remarked, snapping her fingers.
At this, thinking he was being called, the dark elf steward rushed
over to the table, much to Lazuli’s panic. But Asuna took the
opportunity to order some honey ale, and as the waiter left,
Highston took over the explanation.
“You’re correct—the Q is short for quest. And sack came from our
baseball-playing friend here, to refer to the sacks of gold we would
come away with.”
Asuna burst into cute laughter, and I added a stifled gurgle of my
own that was much less cute. Since all the guilds we knew had cool,
flashy names like Dragon Knights Brigade and Legend Braves, the
sheer simple honesty of Qusack being short for questing for sacks
had tickled our funny bones.
The honey ale was conveniently brought out at that moment, and I
took a swig of the sweet, refreshing liquid to quench my thirst. “I
see…I’ll be honest, I thought you folks were a little fishy at first, but
the riddles are being answered for me. So the reason your gear is so
good, despite you being broke, is because it’s all quest rewards.”
And the reason you looked so uncomfortable when we admitted we
were in the front-line group was because you felt guilty about dropping
out, I mentally added. But something in the way Gindo tugged his
short beard told me he understood my meaning.
“Yes, that’s right. You tend to get more experience than money for
quests…and between all the rewards with a selection of loot to take,
80|P

you can assemble a pretty good set. Unfortunately, you need to go
hunting to get those sacks of coins, though.”
“Now that you mention it, that’s true,” I admitted. But there was still
one question on my mind. For being a quest-focused guild, how was
it that they seemed so fresh and clean even after reaching Castle
Galey? The giant insects and arthropods in the barren canyons
outside were about the toughest of the generic monsters you could
find at this point.
“So…you’re telling me…that you started the dark elf faction of the
“Elf War” campaign quest on the third floor, and you came here to
Castle Galey to continue the hidden key quests?” I wondered.
The four members of Qusack nodded. “That’s right. Didn’t you? Have
you already recovered the key from this floor?” Highston asked. I
glanced at Asuna before replying.
“Yeah, we just got back from finishing it. If you’d like, we can tell you
the main points to watch out for.”
“That would be much appreciated.” He smiled, inclining his head.
Then he turned toward the water.
“But I suppose the random mobs along the path were tougher than
the actual riddle solving…Did you have trouble with the giant bugs on
the way to the castle?” I asked, a very smooth leading question by
my standards. My partner saw through this attempt, though, and
cleared her throat uncomfortably. The four were as straightforward
as their guild name suggested, though; none appeared skeptical of
my question.
“Oh, we just left the attacking to our escort and focused on guarding
the whole time…” Gindo said, which didn’t immediately make sense
to me.
“…E-escort? You hired another player…?”

81|P

“Oh no. We don’t have the money for that. I mean the dark elf
NPC…Don’t you have one, too?” he asked. I glanced at Asuna again.
The first thought in my head at “dark elf NPC” was Kizmel, but she
wasn’t our guard or escort, and we didn’t reunite with her until we
arrived at Castle Galey. Or did that mean they had their own
“Kizmel”? Like us, did they manage to beat the Forest Elven Hallowed
Knight in the Forest of Wavering Mists, avoiding Kizmel’s death and
giving them a companion…?
I glanced around the dining hall but saw no one that fit the bill.
Perhaps they had already broken up the party at the time they
arrived, but that might mean that our Kizmel in the treasure
repository might run across their Kizmel somewhere in the castle. I
couldn’t imagine what would happen if that came to pass.
Asuna filled in the silence I was leaving. She asked hoarsely, “What
is…your escort’s name…?”
“Name?” repeated Gindo, taken aback. He looked at his companions.
“You guys know that blelf’s name…?”
The other three shook their heads. Lazuli said, “The cursor just says
Dark Elf Scout. Wouldn’t that be the name?”
Now it was our turn to glance at one another. Kizmel was a knight,
not a scout. Her official title was Dark Elven Royal Guard. That made
it much less likely that Qusack’s escort was another Kizmel, but I had
to be sure.
“By the way, what’s the gender of your escort…?”
“A man. He’s a real dick,” said Temuo. Both Asuna and I exhaled.
Upon further inquiry, we learned that, as initially designed, their
entry event to the quest featured the dark elf and forest elf both
dying. The four managed to complete the camp commander’s quests
somehow, but at the final mission on the third floor, “Retrieving the

82|P

Key,” they were given a Dark Elven Scout to serve as their escort and
fifth party member. Apparently, he vanished at the entrance of
human towns, then reappeared when they left them. If they
undertook unrelated quests or hunted in any one spot, he would
disappear again. He was exceedingly cold, as befitted a dark elf, and
did not engage in any kind of personal or small talk.
When I did the “Elf War” campaign quest in the beta as a solo player,
I didn’t get an escort; what they were experiencing was probably a
support measure added to the official release, but if that elf was
anywhere near as strong as Kizmel, I could see how these four questcentric players had gotten to Castle Galey without any damage.
But at the same time, I sensed danger. This questline continued to
the ninth floor. That scout escort would vanish there when the quest
was over. Would they be able to keep up after that point without
someone to do the heavy damage for them?
I wondered these things and more as I sipped at my honey ale but
decided that it wasn’t really my business. They’d done their other
quests outside of the elf campaign without a bodyguard, and Asuna
and I certainly received a great amount of tactical and emotional
benefit from Kizmel’s presence. Given that the scout was just a
simple bodyguard NPC to them, Qusack might find it easier to move
on when the campaign was done without losing motivation.
“…Gosh, look at the time,” Gindo said, rousing me from my thoughts.
The plates on the table had been cleaned off, and Temuo and Lazuli
looked sleepy. Gindo closed his window, got to his feet, and patted
Temuo on the head.
“Kirito, Asuna, it was a pleasure to chat with you. We’re going to get
our quest from the lord of the castle, so we’ll take our leave for
today…”

83|P

“No, thank you for letting us take up your time,” said Asuna, getting
up from her chair. I inclined my head, too. We agreed to meet up
again in the morning and watched the four of them leave the hall.
When the doors closed and their cursors vanished from view, I gave
my temporary party member a look. After a long few seconds, Asuna
muttered, “I guess there are also people like them up near the front
line, too.”
“I never considered the possibility of a quest-focused guild…Even
without grinding for levels, you can get this far on quest loot alone, I
guess.”
“Not that we do that much grinding, either,” she pointed out.
“That’s true.”
A lull followed, and eventually, we exhaled simultaneously. It was a
good thing that more players were becoming focused on leaving the
towns and reaching the frontier—and being quest-centric opened up
new possibilities for that. Our meeting with Gindo’s group was a
welcome development—but there was something in my chest that
itched about it and refused to go away.
Perhaps it was just some infantile irritation that others had intruded
on our supposed private relaxation time around the castle with
Kizmel. Castle Galey was a public location, so all players had the right
to visit. In SAO, as in any MMORPG, it was a classic violation of
manners to “claim” a public space and refuse others the right to be
there.
As fellow members of the dark elf faction of this questline, this was
actually a place for us to trade useful information. I told myself to
stop being childish and selfish—and to follow Asuna’s example in the
way she had cordially interacted with Qusack. And yet…
“…Earlier, I said I wasn’t a fan of instances. Now I take that back,” my
partner said out of the blue. I stared at her.
84|P

“Wh…why?”
“Because! Anyway, where has Kizmel gone off to?” she snapped,
clearly trying to change the subject and looking around the dining
hall for no good reason. Virtually all the other dark elves had
continued on their way, and of course, Kizmel wasn’t here.
“M…maybe she went back to her room…”
“Well, we should go back, too, then.”
“Y-yeah, good idea.”
The fencer promptly strode away, and as I followed her, I wondered
if I would ever fully understand the way her mind worked…
No, I decided with a sigh, that day would probably never come.

85|P

WHEN WE OPENED THE DOOR TO OUR GUEST ROOM on the third
floor of the west wing, intent on changing clothes before we visited
Kizmel’s chamber, both Asuna and I exclaimed with surprise. The
slender elf knight was already sitting on the sofa in our room.
“What are you doing here, Kizmel?” asked Asuna, trotting over to
her.
The knight lifted a narrow glass in her right hand. “I was waiting for
you, of course. Have you finished talking with the new visitors?”
“Huh? You knew we were meeting with other play…I mean, other
human warriors?” I asked, which brought a little curl of a smile to her
lips.
“But of course. I kept my distance, not wanting to interfere.”
“You wouldn’t have been a bother at all…”
Despite my reassurance, however, it was indeed a good thing for us
that Kizmel had been considerate. Kizmel was far more human in her
mannerisms and intelligence than other dark elves—and certainly
more than the generic Dark Elf Scout accompanying Qusack. I
couldn’t imagine how they might react to her, and it wasn’t clear
what effect it would have on her to interact with players who might
speak openly about the fact that this world was just a VR game.
In the online RPGs I played before SAO, I was not good at actual roleplaying. But somehow, it had become natural for me to assume the
role of a “human swordsman traveling across Aincrad” when
interacting with the dark elves—a development that filled me with a
mild wonder.
Kizmel waved at us to sit. “Did you finish speaking with the new
visitors?”

86|P

“Yes, they said they were going to visit with the master of the
castle,” Asuna explained. The knight placed a new glass before her
and poured a pale-golden liquid from the bottle on the table. When
she did the same for me, I noticed a refreshing, familiar scent wafting
up. It must have been that moontear wine that her sister Tilnel
loved.
We shared a toast, and I took a sip of the rather strong alcohol—that
couldn’t actually get you drunk—before saying, “I think those four
will be leaving the castle in the morning to go to the shrine in the
south, so we won’t see them until the evening. It’s your valuable day
off tomorrow, so we should find our own useful task to—”
Softly and suddenly, Asuna jabbed me with her elbow. I looked at her
in bewilderment before I realized what I’d just done.
The four members of Qusack were going south tomorrow to retrieve
the Agate Key from the shrine. The same key that we’d just brought
back today.
This set of six hidden keys that would open the mysterious Sanctuary
device, which the dark elf legends held would destroy Aincrad, and
which the forest elves believed would return it to the earth, would
not exist in duplicate. As far as Kizmel knew, we had gone from the
third to the sixth floor and, through great trials, had managed to
collect four of these precious, one-of-a-kind keys.
But within the game system, there were as many secret keys as there
were players undertaking the “Elf War” questline. At this moment,
Qusack was receiving a request from Count Galeyon to recover the
Agate Key. What if they left tomorrow and returned after finishing
the quest—and Kizmel witnessed them carrying a new copy of the
key? It could very well happen.
What if she asked us why the four of them were going to that very
same shrine? If NPCs in this game had such advanced AI, shouldn’t

87|P

they be programmed with the ability to integrate that information
and take it all in stride?
“I see…It is much to ask of you humans, I know,” Kizmel murmured.
She drank down the last of her wine. I picked up the bottle
automatically and reached out to pour her another glass, then
cautiously asked, “Uh…do you know the reason they’re going to the
shrine, Kizmel?”
“To retrieve the hidden key, of course.”
“…”
Asuna and I stared at the dark elf, who seemed unbothered by the
knowledge. When she noticed us staring, she looked a bit curious,
then smiled. “Ah…so you did not know, then.”
“D-didn’t know what?” Asuna asked quietly.
Kizmel’s smile turned a bit apologetic. “The commanding officer of
the vanguard force explained that he was using knights to confuse
and mislead the forest elves, did he not? We are arranging a similar
thing for the duty of retrieving the keys.”
“Wh…what does that mean?”
“Even after we recovered the keys from the shrines, other knights
and scouts have headed to the same shrines, carrying false keys
mocked up by our priests to our camps and fortresses. If any humans
pledge assistance along the way, we accept it. This is all to mislead
the forest elves, remember…”
“…”
Asuna and I had no words. The existence of fake keys itself was a
surprise, but even more than that…
“But then…wouldn’t that expose those decoy knights and soldiers to
danger…?” I asked, stunned.

88|P

Kizmel looked down. “That is correct. More than a few knights have
been attacked by the forest elves, and I understand some have lost
their lives.”
“But…why do you need to go to such lengths?!” Asuna demanded,
leaning forward. The knight placed a gentle hand on her shoulder.
“Because that is how serious a duty it is to retrieve the sealed keys,
and the mentality one needs to undertake the mission. Failure is
unacceptable. Now the history and knowledge of the collected
peoples of Lyusula, Kales’Oh, humankind, and dwarfkind are
contained within this floating castle, and should it collapse, all will be
lost…along with many, many lives. We cannot allow ruin to come to
the things that the priestess of yore gave her precious life to protect.
I believe that Her Majesty the queen wants the six keys so she can
keep the Sanctuary door shut forever…”
Kizmel stopped there, but my mind was half-occupied with other
things. After Asuna and I interfered in the battle between Kizmel and
the Forest Elven Hallowed Knight back on the third floor, the duels
between dark and forest elves had continued without end. This was
only natural, as it was the event that entered a player into the “Elf
War” campaign quest, but if Kizmel’s explanation was taken at face
value, it suggested that the elves undertook even this unavoidable
matter of the story’s convenience at the risk of their own lives.
But had the designer of this quest, some writer at Argus, really
considered this angle when designing it? It was common sense that
in an MMORPG, the same events occurred for each player; anything
less wouldn’t be fair. When seen from inside the game world, it
would look like the same character was dying and coming back to
life, over and over, but no player was going to complain about this
being illogical. That little girl from my Anneal Blade quest, for
example, spent an eternity getting sick and being cured, back and
forth.
89|P

Was it really the game’s designers who created these secondary
elements like fake keys and decoy knights, in order to protect the
integrity of the worldview and the game mechanics under the hood?
Or was it something else, like the very world itself…?
“What is it, Kirito?”
I looked up when I heard my name and met eyes with Kizmel, who
had been equally lost in thought.
“N-nothing…just thinking about things…”
“I understand how you feel. Sometimes even I wonder if the four
keys we are carrying around are the real thing or not.”
“Uh…for real?” I asked, accidentally slipping into some real-world
slang, but that saying had clearly been absorbed into Kizmel’s
vocabulary at this point, and she paid it no mind.
“Yes, for real. It would have been real because we took it from the
shrine, but once it has been placed in the vault of a fortress or castle,
there is no telling if the priests might have switched it out…”
“Ah, I see…”
So it’s potentially true that both our keys and Qusack’s keys are
fakes…Or maybe the story holds that they’re both real…? I wondered,
once again lost in questions that had no answer.
Next to me, Asuna asked, “If you’re going to the length of creating
false keys to distract the forest elves, wouldn’t it be a bad thing to
have the keys, real or fake, collected in the same place? I mean, Yofel
Castle got attacked…”
“Yes, there is a logic to what you say,” agreed Kizmel, who looked up
at the ceiling.
The guest chamber at Yofel Castle had huge windows that afforded a
view of the outside, but Castle Galey was carved right into the rock,
so the windows were only on the hallway side. They compensated
90|P

with plenty of interior lights; in addition to the wall-hanging lamps
that the inns in Stachion and Suribus had, there was an elaborate
candelabra hanging from the ceiling like a chandelier, its little fires
flickering.
“We assumed that Yofel Castle would never be attacked. The forest
elves on the fourth floor had only a few small boats, and we couldn’t
have imagined they would team up with the fallen elves…If you had
not warned us, we would not have prepared for the attack in time.
Even with Viscount Yofilis’s power, the castle might have been lost.
But…”
Kizmel looked back at us and gave a reassuring smile. “Even with the
wicked cleverness of the Fallen, it is impossible for them to attack
Castle Galey with a huge army. As you saw for yourselves, I could not
take ten steps outside of this place without the Greenleaf Cape. The
forest elves will have some kind of similar cloak, but surely in only
small numbers…And that cape was sewn from the leaves of the Holy
Tree; there shall never be another of its kind. Even the boar warriors
of the forest elves would not dream of attacking this castle with no
more than ten, at risk of losing all the treasures handed down since
the Great Separation.”
“What about the fallen elves? Is it possible that they have something
similar?” Asuna persisted, but Kizmel again shook her head.
“Have you forgotten? The Fallen were cursed by the Holy Tree. If
they should put on the cape made of its leaves, they would be
burned to ash…or something similar, if not to such an extreme. The
pain and scarring would be intense, regardless.”
“Oh…y-you’re right,” Asuna said, sticking out her tongue to show
how forgetful she was. Kizmel chuckled back, but her mirth did not
last for very long. She folded her arms in a thinking pose.

91|P

“But as Asuna says…keeping the keys in one place for too long is only
inviting needless risk, perhaps. There is a spirit tree here at the
castle, so I suppose I shall have to give up my day of rest and
continue as soon as the morning arrives…”
Whaaat? I was going to shout, but Asuna was quicker.
“No!” She practically flew over the low table to Kizmel’s side and
grabbed the knight’s hands in her own. “I’m sorry that I caused you
to worry. I understand now that this castle is safe. Just stay with us
tomorrow! I’ve been thinking about what we would do!”
Kizmel’s dark-purple eyes blinked several times, and then—how
many times had I seen this by now?—gave the gentle smile of an
older girl to her younger sister.
“All right. Then I will leave in two days, as originally planned. What
shall we do tomorrow?”
“It’s still a secret. I’ll announce it in the morning, so look forward to
the surprise,” Asuna said with a grin. I, however, felt a bit unnerved
by that.

92|P

93|P

Minutes later, the slender wine bottle was empty, and Kizmel
slumped against the back of the sofa. “Whew…I believe I am a bit
intoxicated.”
I examined her face, but the coffee-brown skin was not any different
from usual, and I couldn’t anticipate what would happen to an AI if it
got drunk. Asuna looked worried, however, and asked, “Are you all
right? Can you get back to your room?”
“Ha-ha, I am not so drunk that I cannot stand. But…” she said,
pausing to look at us in turn, “the room I’ve been given is too large
for one person. Do you mind if I sleep on this long couch tonight?”
“Wha—?!” I yelped out of reflex, but in fact, Asuna and I had no
reason to refuse her. I was going to tell her it was perfectly all right,
of course, until I realized something: In a situation with two women
and one man, it seemed clear which one of the three should take the
sofa.
“Uh, in that case, you can sleep in the bedroom with Asuna, Kizmel.
I’ll sleep on the sofa instead.”
But the knight arched her back and shook her head. “No. This is your
room…I cannot force you out of your bedchamber, Kirito. I would
rather return to my room, in that case.”
She started to get to her feet, but Asuna grabbed the end of her thin
tunic. Asuna was still in her sulky begging mood. She grumbled and
glanced at the bedroom door. “That bed…can fit three people,
right?”
“Huh?!” I yelped again, unable to help myself.
But Kizmel was very rational about it. “Oh, I do believe you are
right.”

94|P

“B-but that only leaves about half a meter of space between each
person…” I argued, before wondering if dark elves understood the
measurement systems of the real world.
Kizmel just shrugged her shoulders. “It is not much different from
when the three of us shared that tent at the camp on the third floor.
Or do you not want to sleep in the same bed as me, Kirito?”
“Th-that’s not what I’m saying.” It was the only answer I could give to
that question. The knight grinned mischievously.
“Then, there is no problem.”
We still had to figure out the issue of how we would arrange
ourselves in the bed, and the consensus was that Kizmel would take
the middle, with Asuna on the left and me on the right. I’d been
worried about the space, but Asuna and Kizmel huddled closer,
leaving me with a bit less than a meter of space to work with.
I got into the bed after them and kept my body as straight as an
arrow, just far enough from the edge that I wouldn’t fall over. With
our arrangement, at least I wouldn’t repeat the catastrophe from
this morning, but there was still the possibility that I would wake up
clinging to Kizmel somehow. And I was pretty sure that the antiharassment code for inappropriate contact with an NPC skipped over
the stage where the victim hit the button on a pop-up window and
simply auto-transported the offender when the warning period ran
out. I didn’t want to wake up in a cell, so it didn’t hurt to keep as far
away as I could…
“If you sleep on the edge like that, you’ll fall out of the bed, Kirito,”
said a whisper in the deep darkness. A hand wriggled through the
blanket and grabbed my right arm. I reluctantly scooted a bit closer,
at which point my fingertips brushed some part of Kizmel.
“You will be warmer if you snuggle closer.”
“N-no, I think I’m fine right here.”
95|P

“You should not be at an age where you are bashful about this sort
of thing…”
Does she mean I’m too grown up? Or I’m too much of a child? I
wondered, but Kizmel did not elaborate. If Asuna wasn’t interrupting
this whispered conversation, then it was a sure sign she was already
asleep.
On the other hand, it was true that the temperature improved quite
a bit from just that much movement, and I felt very drowsy. I closed
my eyes and let out a long, slow breath.
When I was a child, I found it very difficult to sleep anywhere but my
own bed. I had trouble falling asleep on the outdoor school field trips
in elementary school and even on family vacations.
It had been the same when I first came to this world. More than a
few times, I ended up farming a single spot overnight because I
couldn’t get to sleep anyway. But at some point, it just stopped
happening. Regardless of the fact that I slept in a different place
virtually every night, I could be fast asleep within ten minutes of
getting under the covers.
I wondered idly if it was because I’d gotten used to the experience of
sleeping in a virtual world, but then I realized that wasn’t true. I
hadn’t found it easy to fall asleep until I started working with Asuna.
There was more trouble in my life this way than when I was solo, I
thought, which made this strange…Or perhaps it was that in
exchange for all the extra troubles and considerations, I was
receiving something else that counterbalanced all that.
As I drifted off into into slumber, I hoped that it was the same way
for Asuna and Kizmel.
The night of January 3 passed in silence…
…or so I thought.

96|P

A forceful alarm woke me, stabbing deep into my brain. Without
opening my eyes, I felt for my game window and turned off the
alarm that only I could hear.
My eyelids rose to see that the room was still dark. Before I entered
the bedroom, I had set an alarm for two o’clock, so of course it was
dark, but now I felt like I shouldn’t have bothered. I focused on the
sounds of the room and heard only peaceful slumber from Kizmel
and Asuna, which made me want to go back into that pleasant
warmth, too. It was willpower alone that forced my eyes to stay
open.
Once I had maintained thirty continuous seconds of wakefulness, the
temptation of sleep subsided. Careful not to wake the two women, I
snuck out of bed and into the living room.
It occurred to me as I crept along that, to a dark elf, an alarm that
only I could hear would fall under their category of “human charms.”
Still, I carefully opened the door and went out into the hallway. I was
50 percent certain that Kizmel at least would detect my movement,
but it seemed that I had pulled it off. I opened my window again and
equipped my long coat and sword.
There were no humanoid figures on either side of the curving
hallway. No guard was likely to scold me if they spotted me, but just
in case, I stayed quiet as I headed to the staircase in the center of the
west wing.
When the bell rang early in the evening, I had plunged down these
stairs, but this time, I was slow and deliberate in climbing them. As I
remembered from the beta, the stairs continued past the fourth
floor, which was the highest in the castle. Eventually, they ended in a
small door. I turned the knob and pushed it open. Fresh, chilly air
instantly surrounded me.

97|P

The doorway led out onto the roof of the castle’s west wing. There
was no man-made light here, but the moonlight coming from the
outer aperture of Aincrad was just enough to keep the dark at bay.
Then again, the exterior of the staircase corridor itself was about the
only feature of note on the vast roof anyway. In a single-player RPG,
you’d expect to find a chest or two in a secluded location like this,
but here, there wasn’t even so much as a pebble to pick up.
Unlike the polished castle walls, the surface here was rough and
pockmarked. I walked along the exterior that bordered the
courtyard. There were parapets barely a third of a meter tall, but
they weren’t going to prevent anyone from falling. It was a good
twenty meters down to the paving stones below, so a headfirst fall
could prove fatal.
I made sure I was alone, just in case, then leaned over to stare into
the courtyard at scenery that was the polar opposite of its daytime
setting. Countless little torch lights cast the huge spirit tree in
alternating navy blue and orange, and the dew that hung and
dripped from its leaves and branches shone like liquid fire. Pairs of
guards marched slowly around it, like a vision from some fantastical
dream.
After a moment of entranced viewing, I snapped back to attention
and examined every part of the courtyard I could see—nothing was
amiss. The bells hadn’t rung, so that meant no one had entered the
castle, NPC or player, but I still had to check to make sure, before I
allowed myself to step back from the edge.
When I turned around, I looked at the exterior of the castle instead.
Galey was a castle that had been carved into the walls of a previously
extant circular stone hollow, so the outer edges were surrounded by
sheer natural cliffs. Even from the roof, it was nearly ten meters to

98|P

get to the top, so despite the Sword of Eventide’s agility bonus, I
couldn’t quite race up the cliff.
But since the beta, I’d always wondered what exactly might be found
beyond this rock face. I was sure that the castle gates on the south
side were impregnable, but until I saw it for myself, I had trouble
ruling out intruders coming from atop the cliffs. I needed to make
sure the possibility of a forest elf invasion was no more than zero.
I pulled my gaze away from the cliff wall and began walking to the
right. Up ahead loomed the three-part gabled roof of the castle’s
center building, which was one floor taller than either of the wings.
The angle was steep but not vertical like the cliffs.
The peak of the roof reached the edge of the cliff, so my thinking
back in the beta was that I could just climb that structure instead.
But no matter how I tried back then, I always slipped and fell back
down after about three meters. However, my stats were better now,
and my boots were higher quality, with good grip. I came to a stop
about twenty meters from the gabled roof, envisioned the course I
would take, and began to sprint.
With about five meters to go, I hit max speed. Under the roof was
the forbidden fifth floor of the central building, which probably
included the count’s private chambers, so there was a possibility I
could get myself in major trouble, but that was something to worry
about later. A massive jump got me to the midsection of the roof,
and from there, I began to Wall-Run diagonally up the seventydegree slope. I felt my soles slipping at the fifth step, and they gave
way a few centimeters by the seventh, but I managed two more
steps before jumping again.
If I grunted with effort, it might wake up Count Galeyon just under
the roof, so I had to make do with silent emphasis, stretching as far
as I could reach. My fingertips grasped the lip of the cliff, and I let the
momentum boost me and scrabbled for all I was worth.
99|P

I was prepared to be met by an invisible purple barrier set up by the
system itself, but it did not happen. I managed to pull myself up the
wall and rolled over onto my back, panting for several long moments.
What I’d just done didn’t—as far as I knew—expend a single calorie
of energy from my actual physical body, but when you worked your
avatar to its physical limit, there was always a period of heavy
breathing afterward.
But in just a matter of seconds, the feeling passed, and I slowly sat
up.
All that I saw before me was flat. I doubted the designers had cut
corners here, but the only thing ahead was rough, flat rock, with
hardly any features or change in elevation. I stood up and kicked the
ground. It was very tough—at the very least, it seemed like I didn’t
have to worry about slipping through some polygonal crack and
clipping into another dimension.
In other words, it could support the weight of hundreds of soldiers.
Kizmel claimed that the elves couldn’t move through the dusty
canyon outside of Castle Galey without capes made of leaves from
the Holy Tree, but there was no guarantee that this held true for the
top of this cliff, too. I needed to ascertain if there was any other way
up here aside from the roof of the castle.
After a brief survey, I started walking directly north. There wasn’t a
single monster or even a cactus on top of the flat mountain, so I used
the massive pillar supporting the next floor of Aincrad in the far
distance as a landmark, utilizing nothing but moonlight for
illumination.
Asuna liked high places, and I figured she would enjoy the barren
terrain, but there was a good reason for not bringing her. Truth be
told, I still didn’t entirely trust the members of Qusack. It was true
that if you beat all the many, many quests so far, you would earn as
much XP as if you were efficiently farming monsters, and you would
100|P

get high-spec gear as quest rewards. With a powerful, ever-present
dark elf soldier around as a bodyguard, it wasn’t unthinkable that the
four would reach this castle, even without much battle experience.
But it still didn’t answer the question of why they would do this.
Their claimed reason for leaving the safe haven was to earn money
for food and lodging—in other words, to make their waiting time in
the Town of Beginnings as pleasant as possible. Apparently, they
were surprised to learn how strong they were and temporarily hoped
they could reach the advancing group, but that dream ended after
the disaster with the Swamp Kobold Trapper.
So that led to being quest-centric, forming a guild based around
“making sacks with quests”…That all made sense. What bothered me
was the timing of their arrival here at the frontier of player progress.
At present, the only people farther ahead than us were the ALS and
DKB, proceeding on the counterclockwise route around the floor
toward its end, with the Bro Squad and Argo the info broker
accompanying them. There was no good intel out yet on the
monsters and tricky terrain of this slice of the sixth floor, and even
with a powerful NPC accompanying them, the risk of death was
greater than zero. If I were in their position, I would stay one floor
down from the front-line group at a minimum and only engage in
quests when I had plenty of help from Argo’s strategy guides. The
“Elf War” campaign quest wasn’t some race to be first anyway.
So there had to be some other reason for their rush to reach Castle
Galey. Perhaps someone had hired them to do something. Perhaps
someone who wished to do us harm. In other words, I couldn’t rule
out the suspicion that Qusack had some connection to Morte’s PK
gang.
There was a 99 percent chance I was overthinking it, but coming
right on the heels of that paralysis-attack incident, I swore never to

101|P

be caught unawares again. If Qusack was connected to or
manipulated by Morte, they would search for alternate routes into
the castle. And the first thing to come to mind would be crossing the
cliff that formed the back half of the castle. As the historical battles
of Ichi-no-Tani and Itsukushima had shown, the best traditional
means of ambush was to come down a cliff…or maybe I was just
being dramatic.
I strode across the desolate rock, my eyes carefully combing the area
for information. Still, no people or monsters to be seen. If I did a full
perimeter lap and encountered no one, I’d have to give the members
of Qusack a silent apology the next time I saw them.
“Wha—? Yow!”
The next moment, I let out an actual yelp and struggled to pull back
the leg I had extended. My balance rocked, and I windmilled my
arms, trying to catch air. There was no ground beneath my extended
foot. Blended perfectly in color between the rocky ground and the
background was an abrupt cliff, as sharp and clean as if cut by a
knife. The drop was over thirty meters, it looked like.
With the help of the air expelled from my lungs, I managed to pull
my center of gravity backward and plopped onto my butt.
When my heart stopped pounding, I crawled forward and timidly
peered over the edge. The cliff was so sheer it was practically an
overhang that continued all the way to the ground below. No player
or forest elf could climb that surface. It was impossible.
I backed up, still on all fours, and only stood once I was a safe
distance from the cliff. I opened my window and checked the map to
find that the distance between my present location and the outer
aperture of Aincrad was not much more than two hundred meters.
This was the northern tip of the rocky mountain.

102|P

It was nearly three in the morning now, but I had to find out how far
this cliff went. I took a bottle of water out of my inventory for a quick
swig, then started walking east. Though I was keeping a safe distance
from the edge, in the darkness of predawn night, it was very hard to
tell where the line was. I wished I had a lantern for light, but if any
other players were on top of the mountain, they would certainly see
it—there was no cover at all on the plateau’s surface.
The trudging continued, with maximum care given to the ground
around me. Occasionally, I approached the edge and peered over but
never saw any change in the angle. I started to wonder if I was just
overthinking things with regard to a forest elf ambush or a sinister
Qusack angle—until about fifteen minutes later, when—
I saw something I absolutely did not expect to see.
It was not a protrusion from the rock floor, but a hollow. A
descending staircase, cut right down into the stone without any
structure overhead, like something from an early RPG. There was
faint flickering of firelight coming from farther down the stairs.
“…”
I stopped for two seconds before my brain started running again, and
then I silently got down on one knee. A little touch on the edge of
the stairs told me that, like the castle itself, they were carved straight
down into the rock. The chisel-mark texture was very similar to the
castle’s, but I couldn’t yet be sure that it was also done by dark elves.
If there just so happened to be someone hostile down there, and
they were dangerous enough that I died in the fight, there was no
way I could ever apologize to Asuna and Kizmel for my foolishness.
For both figurative and literal reasons, of course.
Sadly, I knew I ought to avoid danger for now and go back to speak
with the women. But when I stood up to leave, I sensed an olfactory
input that was out of place.
103|P

It wasn’t a nasty smell. Just the opposite, in fact. It smelled like
spices, onion, and fatty meat cooking. There was nothing else I could
compare it to—it smelled like a good old hamburg steak.
“………”
For three seconds, my mind went haywire. My stomach curled up,
and saliva flooded my mouth. Only when it threatened to drool out
of my lips did I come to my senses.
There on my knees, I considered the situation: If what awaited at the
bottom of the stairs was some kind of ogre that lured prey with the
smell of a steak so that it could kill and eat them, then going down
there to my death would make me a world-class idiot. But…but what
if there was some tiny chance that this staircase was an invitation
from the hamburg steak fairy, who only appeared one time a year?
After all, there were cacti that only fruited for thirty minutes out of
an entire year, so couldn’t this miracle happen as well?
I clenched my fists for about ten seconds and finally came to a
decision.
Asuna, Kizmel, I’m sorry. Even knowing this might be a trap…I
believe that I was meant to walk down these stairs.
Then I got to my feet and took a step down into the narrow stairway.
The opening was a square barely over half a meter to a side, so just
from taking three steps down, my stomach hit the ceiling side of the
opening. It seemed like the opening to a stairway should be a
rectangle, I thought, grumbling, and leaned backward so I could
essentially slide down the steps. Only when I was about twenty steps
down did it finally end in a hallway tall enough for me to stand—and
even then, my head nearly touched the ceiling, and I was not
particularly tall.
This space, too, was narrow enough that it was almost impossible for
two people to squeeze past each other, so at least I knew I wasn’t
104|P

going to get attacked by an ogre or giant in here. There was no light
source in the passage, but the red flicker of flame reflected from the
curve about ten meters ahead, and the smell of cooking meat was
getting stronger. I stepped lightly and slowly onward.
When I reached the right turn, I stuck to the corner and peered
around for just a moment before pulling my head back.
“……?”
I played back the still image in my mind like I’d caught it on film, but
it was confusing.
At the end of the hallway was a room about three meters to a side.
In the middle was a small table and chair. The right wall was wooden
shelves, and the left wall featured a small door. On the far wall was a
black cylinder that looked like a heating stove, in front of which
stood someone in a black robe who was peering into the frying pan
on top. The pan, clearly, was the source of the sizzling sound and
tempting smell, but sadly, I couldn’t make out the contents.
The black-robed figure had its back to me, so I couldn’t tell if it was
human, elf, or some other demihuman monster like a goblin or orc.
At the very least, it was shorter than me, so it couldn’t be some maneating ogre. I peered around the corner again, this time looking long
enough that the figure’s color cursor came into focus.
Surprisingly, the black robe seemed made of a very fine material like
velvet. Unruly curls of gray, almost white hair ran down their back,
and on their head, there was a pointed hat of the same material as
the robe. The cursor floating above it was yellow: an NPC. The
figure’s name was BOUHROUM: DARK ELVEN ANECDOTIST. I couldn’t
make out how to say their name, and I had no idea what an
anecdotist was, but I could definitely tell they were a dark elf. So
they weren’t going to just attack me out of the blue…probably.

105|P

I steeled my nerves and rounded the corner, passing through the
open hallway and into the room.
“…G-good evening,” I called out, and the robed dark elf instantly
leaped over a third of a meter into the air, its curly hair flying upward
as it spun around to face me.
“Wh…wh-wh-who goes there?!” demanded the elf, who was
revealed to be, in human terms, an elderly man of at least eighty
years, with his skinny, wrinkled face framed by a small pair of
rounded spectacles. But of course, there were those characteristic
long, pointy elf ears protruding from the curls, so in fact, he could be
hundreds of years old. There was a silver beard that hung from his
chin nearly down to the floor.
Of all the people I’d met in Aincrad, this was clearly the closest to the
classic visual representation of a wizard. But it also struck me for
another reason—a slight feeling of déjà vu…like I had met this fellow
somewhere before, perhaps. But I would never forget someone so
distinctive.
At the very least, the old fellow did not recognize me. His tiny eyes
bulged behind the glasses, and his lengthy beard quivered as he
shouted, “B…boy! You’re a human, aren’t you?! How did you get into
my secret chamber?!”
“How…? Th-the normal way, down the stairs…” I said, pointing to the
hallway I’d just walked down. The old man raised a fist.
“You fool, that is not an entrance!”
“Huh? Then…what is it?”
“It is my chimney vent! And besides, that is the bald mountain top up
there, where even birds do not dare to cross! How did you climb up
there?!”

106|P

“W-well…” I stammered, thinking I would probably be in trouble if I
told him the truth. Then again, I was clearly already in trouble with
him, so what was the difference? “I climbed up the roof of the
central castle building…”
“……”
Now both the man’s eyes and his bearded mouth hung round and
open, an expression that lasted for over three seconds before he
finally emitted a strange burst of noise.
“Ka-hya! Ka-hya-hya-hya…You are telling me…that a young human
boy climbed his way…up the roof of little Melan’s bedchamber…?”
Apparently, the ka-hya sound was his laughter. He lowered his raised
fist and stroked his beard with the other hand. In a softer voice, the
old man continued, “I see, I see. So the human swordsman who’s
been helping with the key collection must be you. I understand now
that you are not a thief, but what would bring you to climb the
mountain in the dead of night like this?”
“Well, uh…I was out for a night stroll, you know…a little night
mountain climbing…and I wondered what the top of the cliff was
like. I wandered around until I found your stairs—er, your vent—and
smelled something nice coming out of it…”
“Hwaaaaa!” the old man screamed, and now it was my turn to jump.
But he wasn’t angry, and his AI hadn’t just gone haywire, apparently.
He spun back around with tremendous speed and grabbed the
handle of the frying pan barehanded. “Yeowwww!”
He transferred the hot pan to the table and blew on his nowreddened palm. It was all so sudden and alarming that I didn’t know
what to do—until I saw what was sizzling in the middle of the pan.
It was an elliptical slab of minced meat, about fifteen centimeters
long and seared to a beautiful brown. This was a perfect hamburg
steak, the likes of which I’d never seen in Aincrad before.
107|P

The old man noticed my gaze and ceased blowing on his hand so he
could exclaim, “Wh-what do you want? It’s not for you! This is my
one delight a month, and I haven’t many left to enjoy! Why, you
nearly caused me to char it black.”
“………Hrng…”
If the food was one of the whitefish or chicken dishes that the elves
so often served in their camps and castles, I would have won my
saving roll against temptation and claimed “I didn’t say I wanted to
eat it.”
But this was hamburg steak. It wasn’t my number-one favorite dish
in the world, but without curry or ramen in Aincrad, the sheer impact
of that smell and appearance was nothing short of explosive. The
mental image of a knife sinking into it and producing a rush of meat
juice from inside crowded out every other thought in my brain.
If only there was some way to get this stubborn old man to give up
half his steak…even a third! My mind was working as fast as when
Morte attacked, when I was struck by a humble inspiration. I sucked
in a sharp breath.
The old man used what looked like a wooden spatula to transfer the
hamburg steak to a metal plate. As calmly as I possibly could, given
the circumstances, I asked, “Are you…just having that?”
“…What do you mean?” asked the old man suspiciously, moving the
plate away from me.
“Oh, the human custom would state that such a delicious meat dish
cannot be eaten simply on its own. Only with a side of bread or
mixed vegetables can the flavor of the meat be truly appreciated.”
“Hah!” the old man mocked, waving his free hand. “I grew tired of
vegetables over a hundred years ago. It’s bad enough that the cooks
at this castle try to feed me leafy greens and fruit every day, because

108|P

‘it’ll make you live longer’…To put that rubbish on my plate would be
to ruin my precious fricatelle.”
Fr-fricatelle?
I just barely contained my impulse to ask him how that differed from
a hamburg steak. As long as it looked and tasted like one, it didn’t
matter what the elves called it. Instead, I waved my hand to call up
my game window. The old man clearly hadn’t seen much of the
human Art of Mystic Scribing, as he reacted with curiosity, but I
promptly found what I was looking for and pulled it out of my
inventory.
“Then…what about this?”
In my fingers I held a long, elliptical vivid-purple object. It was the
last of the sweet potatoes dropped by those half-fish monsters. A
regular potato was the best match for this hamburg steak, but I
didn’t have any, and this would do fine anyway.
“…What is that?” asked the dark elf elder, who had apparently lived
centuries without seeing such a thing. His gray brows drooped in
concentration. I rounded the table to show him.
“It’s a sweet potato you can find on the fourth floor. If you crisp this
up in that frying pan, it’ll go great with your hamb…your fricatelle, I
bet.”
If Asuna were here, she’d use her ample vocabulary and knack for
lyrical expression to charm—er, convince—more than a few
stubborn old men to try it out, but it had been my decision not to
wake her up first. The man still looked suspicious, and he lifted his
spectacles to get a better look.
“A sweet potato, you say? It has a strange color…”
“Th-the inside will be the proper shade. It’ll be hot and sweet and
creamy,” I said, like I was some kind of pitchman for a roasted sweet

109|P

potato cart. The old man glanced back and forth between my face
and the potato and, at last, cleared his throat.
“Ahem-hem…Well, I suppose I can try it out. If it is as good as you
say, I will even give you half of my fricatelle. The potato will go
entirely to me, however.”
That seemed like an abuse of privilege, but I’d eaten a number of
Ichthyoid Potatoes, so I could let it slide this time.
The old man took the potato, then placed the frying pan back on the
stove, still slick with the juice and fat of the meat. In the right corner
was a tiny kitchen area, and he went there to slice the sweet potato
into pieces less than two centimeters wide. Then he dropped the
pieces into the pan, which had begun crackling again. Soon, a sweet
scent filled the air.
He peered into the pan, murmuring and exclaiming to himself, and I
watched with more than a little consternation. You didn’t need the
Cooking skill to employ primitive methods like thrusting them into an
open fire, but it seemed like frying one up in a pan with oil required
some amount of expertise. Assuming he had made the steaming
hamburg meat out of ingredient items, it appeared he would have to
possess the Cooking skill.
A minute later, the old man lifted his plate and used a long meat fork
to transfer the potatoes one by one. The circles of sweet potato,
fried and golden, looked perfectly cooked.
“H-how is it?” I asked eagerly, forgetting my manners. He glared at
me out of the corner of his eye.
“I would tell you, if I had eaten a bite yet. Now, then…”
He switched to a normal fork and popped one of the smaller pieces
of sweet potato into his mouth. He chewed it for a good long time,
swallowed, and groaned.

110|P

“Ooooohhhh.”
“H-how is it?” I repeated.
This time, the old fellow looked me straight in the eye and said, “It’s
not bad.”
“Not…bad…”
It seemed like the deal was off, but if so, I felt that I now had the
right to eat all the sweet potato he rejected. Until he said—
“But it would really be terrific with a dab of butter on top.”
“B-butter…?”
At first, I was surprised. There’s butter in Aincrad? But before my
eyes, the old man pulled a small jar off the shelf on the right. He
placed it heavily on the table and said, “Well, don’t just stand there
like an idiot. Sit down, human boy.”
“Uh…y-yes sir.” I sat down on the other little stool at the table, and
the old man set another metal plate in front of me.
“You win, boy. Enjoy half the fricatelle…and, out of my great
magnanimity, these two pieces of potato.”
Before I could say a word, he sliced the jumbo steak in two and
transferred one half, juices flowing outward, onto my plate. Then he
set two pieces of sweet potato next to it, dumped the rest onto his
own plate, and sat across from me. After that, he pulled the jar
closer and stuck a small knife inside, scooping out a heap of a creamy
white substance that he dropped on the potato slices. I did the same
when he passed the jar to me.
The metal plates must have had some kind of heat-retaining magic
on them. I didn’t have the vocabulary to express the devastating
sight of rapidly melting butter on top of fried sweet potato, right
next to a hot, juicy hamburg steak. It was time to turn off my brain

111|P

and indulge. I lifted my knife in one hand and fork in the other and
declared, “Let’s dig in!”
Across the table, the old man had cut a large piece of meat loose and
was lifting it to his mouth. He chewed a few times, popped in a piece
of buttered potato, chewed some more, then put on an expression
of bliss and moaned, “Hwhoaaaa…”
Instantly, I had another blast of déjà vu.
I had definitely seen this old man before. It wasn’t in the last two
months trapped in Aincrad, but before that…Yet, that was obviously
impossible. I didn’t know any ancient dark elves in real life. So
where…?
“Ah…aaaah!” I shouted, rising out of my seat. It earned me a
suspicious look from the man.
“What is it, boy? Why aren’t you eating?”
“I will, I will—but before that…Sir, are you the master of
Meditation…?”
“Hrmm?” the old man grunted, raising just one eyebrow and glaring
at me. “Boy, you know who I am? Yes, I am the greatest storyteller of
Lyusula and a master in the art of meditation, Bouhroum the great
sage. Have we met before?”
We have! In the beta test! I exclaimed in my head. My mouth flapped
pointlessly.
Over the month-long beta test, the only Extra Skill we found was
Meditation. It was a hidden skill that only appeared as a choice when
certain conditions were fulfilled, much like the martial arts skill
earned through the rock-breaking lessons on the second floor. In
fact, Argo the info dealer found martial arts in the beta, too, but it
was right as the test was ending, so the info didn’t get around.

112|P

Therefore, Meditation was the only hidden skill I earned in the beta,
but I remember it being so finicky that I didn’t have much use for it.
The appearance, voice, and speaking style of the NPC with the
Meditation training quest were identical to this steak-cooking old
man. Only his clothes and long ears were different.
The Meditation NPC in the beta was a human elder in a simple brown
tunic. He did not live in a cave near Castle Galey but in a little shack
deep in the swampy western area of the sixth floor. His attitude was
mostly grumpy, and I did not recall him having any special love of
hamburg steak.
But right during the moment I unlocked the Meditation skill, the old
man gave me a satisfied smile that was absolutely identical to the
smile I saw on the dark elf elder as he savored the marriage of steak
and buttered sweet potato. That was what kicked open the door to
my memory. Yes…this Bouhroum (who pronounced it Booh-room)
was the same figure as the Meditation NPC from the beta, just
placed within a different setting and context. I had to choose my
words carefully now.
“…No, I haven’t met you, but I’ve heard the rumors…”
“Aha. So word of my skill and fame has reached even the human
towns? Ka-hya-hya-hya…” he cackled, then stuck another piece of
meat in his mouth, looking positively intoxicated. I realized that I
needed to eat my portion, too, and stuck my knife into the end of the
half of steak on my plate. The seared surface was resilient, but the
inside was light and perfectly cooked. The moment I cut through it,
meaty juices oozed out, exuding a spicy scent.
Anticipation caused the muscles on the inside of my mouth to
tighten, and I lifted my first bite of hamburg steak in over two
months to my mouth. I gave Asuna a silent apology, swore that I
would take her here when we got the chance, and opened my mouth
wide.
113|P

Just then, the man said, “I should ask just in case, boy. Do you wish
to understand the meditative arts?”
“Huh…?” I stared, mouth open wide. To my surprise, there was a
golden ? over his head. The symbol of a new quest, though
Bouhroum himself could not see it.
“Uh, w-well…” I stammered, despite the bite of meat two
centimeters away from my mouth occupying the majority of my
thoughts.
If I answered no, I would probably never get another chance to earn
the Meditation skill. By coincidence, I’d reached level 20 just two
days ago, and I had an open skill slot. But the Meditation skill was of
questionable benefit—you had to assume a funky, Zen-like pose for a
certain time to receive a continual healing buff and a negative status
resistance buff. The shared opinion among beta testers was that
there were better skills you could use a valuable skill slot on.
It was possible that the effects of Meditation had been buffed for the
official launch, so I could just go ahead and take it, then remove it
from the skill slot if it didn’t work out. But remembering how long
and arduous the martial arts training period was kept me from saying
yes.
“Uh, ah, hmm,” I groaned, hoping to delay my answer so I could at
least eat my steak. This was admittedly rather optimistic of me.
“If you wish to train in it, boy, you must not eat that fricatelle.”
“Huh? Wh…why not?”
“Because that is your training—in the arts of Awakening, the special
Meditation technique.”
“A…Awakening…?”
I’d never heard the term before. For a moment, I actually forgot
about the meat on my fork.
114|P

A straightforward interpretation of what he meant was that in the
advancement tree for the Meditation skill, there was a higher ability
called Awakening. But the Meditation NPC in the beta made no
mention of it. I had no idea what it did. Besides…
“Isn’t that something you can’t train unless you already have the
ski…the art of Meditation?” I asked.
Bouhroum took a third bite of his hamburg sleak and smiled. “A very
intuitive youth, you are. That is correct, of course…but the conditions
to train in the art of Awakening involve solving a mystery in the
castle library and discovering the existence of this little room. You
managed to find me here—although it was through the ceiling
vent—so you have fulfilled the requirements.”
“…”
My eyes traveled from Bouhroum’s face to the small door on the left
wall. “You mean…on the other side of that door is the library of
Castle Galey?”
“Correct.”
I suppose I could just leave that way, then, I thought, trying to avoid
facing the challenge before me: the juicy hunk of meat hanging on
the end of my fork.
If I accepted old Bouhroum’s words at face value, the moment I stuck
this hamburg into my mouth, I would no longer be able to acquire
the mysterious Awakening skill. A rational player would find a single
dish of food to be far outweighed by the opportunity to gain an
ultrarare skill, which probably even Argo didn’t know about yet. But
in reality, the allure of that meat just centimeters away from my
mouth, its appearance, smell, and supposed flavor—it was just too
much to resist. This might be my only chance at getting the
Awakening skill, but I’d also gotten this hamburg steak after some
tricky negotiation, and I might not ever get to eat this again, either.
115|P

What should I do…? What should I do?
I clenched my jaw. My fork hand trembled. I was trapped in a tug-ofwar between my brain and my stomach. Across the table, Bouhroum
was stuffing hot meat and buttered sweet potatoes into his mouth
and muttering provocations like “Ooooh, ahhh—it’s so good.” I
stared at my hamburg steak again and, with all the willpower I
possessed, lowered my right hand.
When I’d first started to lift it to my mouth, I had given a silent
promise to the sleeping Asuna that I would bring her here one day.
That was a promise dependent on having more opportunities to eat
this food. I couldn’t make a choice that would permanently take that
option off the table.
Over five-plus agonizing seconds, I lowered my fork to the plate,
breathing heavily, and asked the old man, “Before I train in the art of
Awakening…can I at least eat the potatoes?”
“You may not,” he said mercilessly, then scooped the last bits of
hamburg steak and buttered sweet potatoes into his mouth. His face
went slack, and he moaned, “Ohhh, it’s the best…”
I waited for him to chew and swallow before I said, “Old man…I
mean, Mr. Bouhroum, please teach me the ways of Awakening.”
Abruptly, the ? symbol floating over his head turned to !, indicating
that I had accepted the quest. Bouhroum pulled a handkerchief out
of his robe and carefully wiped his beard before stating imperiously,
“Very well. But the training will not be easy. I have lived a very long
life, but I can count the number of people who passed the trials and
mastered Awakening on my two hands…and none were human.”
“T…trials? Not a training period?”
If it was something like Go to this place and defeat so-and-so
monster, that would actually be preferable. In fact, I prayed he would
say as much.
116|P

The old man stroked his silver whiskers into place and said
cryptically, “It is training, and it is a trial. First, straighten your back.”
“Huh? Uh…okay.” I sat up atop the round stool. This time, his robe
produced a short staff, which he used to tap the metal plate before
me.
There was indeed magic upon that plate, because the cooling meat
suddenly began to sizzle again. The scent of fat, spices, and butter
wafted up, rich and thick, attempting to reawaken the appetite I was
keeping at bay.
“What you must do, for the next three hours…is cast aside your
distractions and maintain the tranquility of your heart. If you can do
this, boy, then you will stand at the entrance to the path of
Awakening.”
“…Tr-tranquility of my heart…?”
Faced with a baffling trial, I glanced back and forth from the steakloving old man to the old man’s beloved steak.
It did sound like an appropriate training method for a meditative
skill, but how was he supposed to determine whether or not my
mind was filled with worldly thoughts and distractions? It wasn’t
really that hard to avoid moving your body or facial muscles in
Aincrad. You could maintain the same avatar posture for hours on
end without getting dead leg or a sore back, and unless you found a
truly bizarre position, the hidden Fatigue stat rarely ever came into
play. I’d never intentionally frozen in place for three hours, but I felt
like I could do it, if need be.
Whatever the actual effect on the skill was, the unlocking conditions
for an advanced Extra Skill couldn’t be easier than martial arts. I had
to assume that Bouhroum had some means of detecting if I was
distracted by something. Or more accurately, that the SAO system
itself, through Bouhroum, had that ability.
117|P

At that point, I realized something.
The NerveGear over my head in the real world was monitoring my
brain’s electrical activity in close detail at all times. So my brain
waves should be radically different between periods of intense
concentration and periods of lazy distraction, and the system—and
thus Bouhroum—could tell the difference that way. If I wanted to
earn the Awakening skill, I couldn’t just hold my avatar still. I needed
to exhibit true mental concentration. For three whole hours. With a
sizzling steak under my nose.
The Awakening skill was intriguing, to be sure, but as a teenager
more interested in food than the opposite sex, I couldn’t imagine
myself keeping focus for that long…
No, wait.
Couldn’t I just use the situation to my advantage and focus on
nothing but the hamburg steak instead? The NerveGear might be
cutting-edge technology, but it couldn’t actually tell the content of
my thoughts. Think about nothing but a steak for three hours
straight? I could do that.
“…All right. Begin the clock whenever you want.”
It was after three o’clock in the morning. By the time I finished my
training, it would be after six, but if I sprinted, I could get back to the
room before Asuna and Kizmel woke up.
As I prepared by taking a deep breath, the old man removed a new
item from his robe and set it on the table. It was a large hourglass
with a wooden frame. It looked essentially the same as the realworld item, except that all the sand was contained in the upper
chamber, and not a single grain was falling.
“Very good. Then we will now begin your training in the arts of
Awakening. Begin!”

118|P

Bouhroum tapped the hourglass with his staff, causing mysterious
green sand to silently spill into the lower chamber. I began to stare
voraciously at the hamburg steak. It was perpetually heated by the
magical plate, but its juiciness hadn’t dried up in the least. The meat
along the cut shone brilliantly, and the juice flowing out of it mixed
with the melted butter on the sliced potatoes, forming a bewitching
marbled puddle on the plate. I wanted to set aside the knife and just
stab the whole thing with my fork in one go. I could see myself slicing
a roll in half and turning it into a hamburger, too. In that case, I
would throw on some barbecue sauce, or even better, spicy-sweet
teriyaki mixed with mayo. Oh, how I wanted it, wanted it, wanted
it……
“Kaaaaah!” Bouhroum suddenly screamed, smacking me hard on the
shoulder with the short staff. “You fool!! You’ve gone and drowned
yourself in impure thoughts!! Start over!!”
“Huh…? You could tell what I was thinking…?”
“Do not mock the great sage Bouhroum! Your head was full of crass,
greedy desire for the fricatelle!”
“Urgh…O-okay, you got me…” I said, drooping my head. The old man
snorted.
“Will you give up, then?”
“No…I’ll keep going.”
“Aha. Very well.” He tapped the hourglass again, and the small
amount of sand instantly returned to the upper chamber. “And now,
once again…begin!”
With a third swing of the staff, I closed my eyes.
So Bouhroum, as an extension of the SAO system and the NerveGear,
had better perception than I counted on. If my plan to think only of

119|P

hamburg steak wasn’t going to work, that made the difficulty much
higher, but I still had to challenge the task of extreme meditation.
I would shut out all sensory information and relax my mind.
Fortunately, spacing out was a skill of mine. I let my mind expand in
the darkness, thinking nothing, but not sleeping, just becoming
empty, empty…What a wonderful smell, though…and the tempting
sizzling sound. I could use this sound as a morning alarm…Oh, what a
smell…How I could go for a teri-mayo burger right about now……
“Kaaaaah!”
Whap! He hit my shoulder a bit harder than before. I yelped. “Ow!”
“That was exactly the same as the last time, boy!” I opened my eyes
to see Bouhroum with his staff raised overhead. “Your first attempt
was ten seconds, and your second was twenty! You will never reach
three straight hours at this rate!”
“Hmmmm…”
Naturally, even with my eyes closed, I could not shut out the sound
and smell of the steak. If anything, they were even stronger. My
hunger was rising, too—it was not going to be easy at all to maintain
an empty mind.
“Will you continue?” the old man asked, his look dismissive. I
grumbled.
I knew the moment my hamburg-focused plan failed that my chances
were slim, but I hated the idea of giving up now. Upon fresh
consideration, the act of continuing a perfect lack of thought for
three whole hours was impossibly hard for a video-game quest.
Perhaps there was some strategy here, a trick that could be
employed to make it easier.
Bouhroum had said to “…cast aside your distractions and maintain
the tranquility of your heart.” I felt like the key was in the

120|P

interpretation of tranquility. Keeping your thoughts focused was not
tranquil if the content of that focus was wanting to eat hamburg
steak. So if I could fix my mind on a target that did not involve desire
or agitation, perhaps I would clear the requirements.
Something I could imagine in detail but that brought peace rather
than agitation.
The first thing that came to mind was my sword. Its appearance,
texture, and weight were already etched into my mind. A sword was
a tool of combat, of course, but when I was feeling down or worried,
clutching the entire scabbard relaxed me for some strange reason,
and when I was ready to stand and fight again, the vitality to do so
came flooding upward. All the players trapped in this world who
hoped to beat the game felt the same way to a greater or lesser
extent: One’s weapon offered mental support.
But I wasn’t sure if I could really maintain a state of tranquility for
three straight hours, just thinking about my sword. The worst would
be if I hung in there for an hour or two, then lost my grip. If I had to
start over with a three-hour countdown, I definitely wouldn’t be able
to get through it, and I could easily imagine Asuna waking up and
sending me messages.
It had to be something with a stronger attachment than just my
sword—and with more vivid memories attached. For one thing, it
had been a while since I had one of my lonely nights against an inn
wall or tree trunk, clutching my sword with both arms to keep the
anxiety away. That was because…
“Ah…” I gasped.
However Bouhroum interpreted that, he then taunted, “What do you
say? Are you giving up? If you do, you may eat that fricatelle.”
“No…I’m doing this,” I announced, telling myself that this would be
the final attempt.
121|P

“Very good. Now…begin!”
He tapped the hourglass with the staff, and the recharged green
sand began to fall again in silence. I closed my eyes, tilted my head
just a bit downward, and opened the door to my memories.
A silver meteor split the darkness of the screen that was my mind.
It wasn’t a real meteor. It was the shining light of a sword skill
finishing off a dangerous Ruin Kobold Trooper deep in the first-floor
labyrinth. The basic rapier thrust, Linear…executed by a fencer
whose name at the time I didn’t even know.
The first thing I had said to the fencer, who slumped back against the
wall after defeating the heavily armed kobold, was A little bit overkill,
if you ask me. Not the most elegant or poetic of sentiments. When
she failed to understand my meaning, I explained the concept of
overkilling, and the fencer replied brusquely Is there a problem with
doing too much damage?
That was how I had first met Asuna, my current ongoing game
partner.
At the time, Asuna kept her hood on all the time, even when eating.
She held her conversation to a minimum, and she never smiled. The
first time she showed me anything resembling a smile was…yes, it
was when we had beaten Illfang the Kobold Lord, boss of the first
floor. I had left the boss chamber first to go activate the second-floor
teleport gate, and she came chasing after me.
She said that for the first time, she’d found something she wanted to
do in this world. When I asked her what that was, she just smiled and
said it was a secret. That had been on December 4…and today was
January 4. A full month had passed, but that smile was still the same,
burned into my memory.
Somehow, I’d forgotten all about the sound and smell of the
hamburg…and moreover, that I was in the midst of a trial for the
122|P

Awakening skill. Instead, I simply relived the route that Asuna and I
had traveled together since then in minute detail.
On the second floor, Asuna’s Wind Fleuret got swept into a weaponupgrading scam, which took a lot of work to unravel. On the third
floor, we met Kizmel and went on an adventure for a secret key. On
the fourth floor, we engaged in water battles riding a canoe we
dubbed the Tilnel. On the fifth floor, we tackled the boss in a tiny
group so as to avoid all-out war between the ALS and DKB.
Throughout all that time, both Asuna and I had found many more
occasions to smile than before, it seemed to me.
Nothing had changed about this deadly place, where “game over”
was forever, and it was hard to hold much hope for the future when
we’d only reached the sixth floor out of a hundred total, but
nevertheless, the two of us—and sometimes three, with Kizmel—
worked our hardest to survive each day.
We nearly died many times. I’d trembled with rage, been devastated
by despair…but I kept walking forward through it all, and that had to
be thanks to Asuna’s presence.
I knew that this arrangement, our partnership, was not meant to last
forever. We met in extreme circumstances, and we must have
sensed something in each other that made us choose to fight
together. If we had never gotten involved in SAO and passed each
other on the street somewhere, neither Asuna nor I would have
stopped or given it a second thought.
For now, I didn’t know how our temporary partnership was going to
end. But that moment would come, whether we broke up our duo or
not. Either our HP would reach zero, and the NerveGear would fry
our brains, or we’d beat the deadly game and be returned to the real
world…So as long as we kept fighting at the front line, one of those
endings would inevitably come.

123|P

So I didn’t want to give a name to whatever emotion I felt toward the
player named Asuna. My role as a former beta tester was to tell her
everything I could and keep fighting by her side when that was no
longer necessary. Asuna had much, much greater ability and
potential than I did. She could be a true leader, more so than the
DKB’s Lind, the ALS’s Kibaou, and even Diavel the Knight himself.
Perhaps the entire meaning of my presence here in this prison world
was to ensure Asuna survived until that grand moment.
On the other hand, I didn’t think of myself as a simple shield or
disposable pawn. I had received many things from Asuna in return.
Every last thing I saw with my eyes closed like this—even her puffedup sulking face, and the feeling of an elbow in my ribs—was a
brilliant entry into my memory and gave me the strength to continue
living.
Until I became trapped in here—really, until I met Asuna—I thought
that dealing with other people was nothing but a bother. I didn’t try
to make friends at school; I put up walls between myself and my
parents and sister; and I only sought out a trifling substitute for
human interaction online.
But the truth was, I’d been built up as a person by the parents who
raised me for fourteen years, the sister who looked up to me despite
my disdain, and all the other people I’d met in life. Every human
being gave something to others and received something in return.
Even Morte and his friends, in the act of trying to kill Asuna and me,
were no exception.
I didn’t know what reason they had for going after us. Morte, the
dagger user I suspected was Joe from the ALS, and the man in the
black poncho who was their leader…They might have their own
motives, their own sympathies, even their own kind of justice.
But when I had decided to use Rage Spike on Morte, that choice of
mine was to kill him in order to protect Asuna. Technically, the Sword
124|P

of Eventide’s accuracy bonus kicked in and struck his heart, and even
knowing that the continual piercing damage would kill Morte within
seconds, I did not attempt to pull it loose.
I only had two hands, and I could not save every last player.
Whatever the PK gang’s reason for trying to kill Asuna, I would strike
back as many times as necessary. I would do anything to protect that
gentle smile I saw on the back of my eyelids, pointed at me…
“…Very well. That is enough,” said a voice, but I could not open my
eyes right in that moment.
But when I recognized whose voice it was and recalled the situation, I
lifted my downcast face. It didn’t seem like three hours had passed
at all, but the green sand of the hourglass was entirely filling the
bottom chamber.
“Is…the training over?” I asked, my throat hoarse, as I looked to the
robed old man across the table.
“Hmph…I am willing to lower my requirements and admit that you
have passed the hurdle to learn the Awakening arts. I suppose, for a
human boy, there is only one thing more precious than a freshcooked fricatelle.”
He made it sound as if he could tell exactly what I was thinking, but I
stopped myself from asking to confirm this suspicion. It would be
beyond uncomfortable to hear him spell out my innermost thoughts
in detail.
Later, I realized that when I restated my desire to fight against
Morte’s gang, my mental state had been drifting further and further
away from tranquility. So perhaps the fact that the old man did not
yell “Kaaaah!” was a sign that he really was observing my thoughts.
But at this point, the rebound of having thought exclusively about
one thing for three hours meant my mind was half-unresponsive. I
watched dully as the golden ! above the old man’s head vanished,
125|P

but as I started to get up from the stool, I realized that the hamburg
steak on the metal plate was still hot.
“Um…since the training is over, can I—?”
But before I could say “eat this,” Bouhroum quickly yanked the plate
back and snapped, “No! If you eat this now, your training will be for
naught!”
“Whaaat…? Really?”
Extra Skills were still a part of the game system, so once you had it in
your skill tree, there shouldn’t be any way that eating a steak would
cause it to disappear. But after how forcefully the old wise man
stated it, I couldn’t really argue.
I stood up, vowing to myself that sometime in the future, I would
bring Asuna here and eat that damn hamburg. As I stood, Bouhroum
sat, sticking his knife into the plate of meat he’d just taken from me.
“Now, get going! And if you ever want to visit again, use the proper
entrance, rather than my ceiling vent!”
“Yeah, yeah,” I grumbled, looking at the door on the left wall, which I
assumed was the “proper entrance” he was talking about. Going
through that door should put me in Castle Galey’s library. It was
probably a shorter trip back to the room that way, but I still had
business to conduct on the top of the rocky mountain.
“Well, I guess I’ll come back sometime. Thanks for everything,
Bouhroum,” I said.
The sage sent me along with a warm “And next time, bring three of
those sweet potatoes—no, four.”
I left the little room, headed up the cramped stairs—er, vent—in the
southern hallway, and returned to the flat mountaintop. According
to my game window, the time was six fifteen in the morning. The sky
through the aperture of Aincrad was violet now, with red rays

126|P

arriving from the east. I sucked in a deep breath of chilly air, hoping
to kick-start my fuzzy mind.
It really was an odd experience. Like it had all been a strange fairy
tale…but when I turned back to look, that square entrance was still
there on the rusty-red rock face.
I shook my head slowly, then switched my window to the skill tab.
On the left side, it indicated five skill slots, four of which were
occupied by one-handed swords, martial arts, Search, and Hiding.
Their proficiency, in that order, was 168, 97, 142, and 117. Martial
arts was lowest because I used it only in a complementary way, but
Hiding was the next lowest because, thanks to my partner, the
number of times I needed to use it was lower than on my own.
Briefly, I considered removing it from the slot but didn’t go through
with it. Just moments ago when unlocking the Awakening skill, I had
reminded myself that my partnership with Asuna wouldn’t last
forever. When I returned to being a solo player, I was going to need
that Hiding skill.
My first line of business was to check out what that unlocked higher
Extra Skill actually did. Asuna and Kizmel could awaken at any time. I
needed to wrap this up and rush back into the castle, but surely I
could just do this first. I sorted my list of skills by unlock date.
As soon as I saw the skill at the top of the list, I let out a yelping
“Fwah…?”
What I found there was not Awakening, as Bouhroum had
mentioned so many times, but the old skill from the beta,
Meditation, which I…hadn’t really used all that much.
“Wh-what’s going on here…?”
I felt like crawling back down the vent to ask the great sage to his
face, but sadly, I didn’t have the time. I craned my neck back and
forth, debating whether to slot it or not, and eventually went ahead
127|P

and dragged the Meditation icon to the left. When I dropped it in the
fifth slot, I gasped again.
“Hngwah…?!”
There should have been the number 0 next to the skill to indicate
proficiency, but it was rising with incredible speed instead. In a blink,
it was over 100, then 200, without slowing down. 300, 400…and only
at 450 did its pace begin to slow, with the tens and single digits still
rotating, until it at last came to a stop exactly at 500.
After three seconds of no thought at all, I rubbed the number with
my fingertip, just in case. It did not magically vanish, of course.
Proficiency, 500.
I’d been using one-handed swords every single day for hours on end
over two months straight, and it was only at 168. And unlike weapon
skills, which rolled a small chance for ticking upward with each
attack, the Meditation skill only received proficiency when you
assumed a Zen pose for close to a minute until the buff kicked in. I
couldn’t even imagine how much Zen meditation you needed to do
to get it to a preposterous number like 500.
I forced my stiff finger to tap the skill name for a detailed pop-up. It
was in the mod screen that I found the source of this strange
phenomenon. In the oddly simplistic mod tree, there was a small
AWAKENING note next to where it said PROFICIENCY: 500.
“…So Awakening wasn’t the name of a different skill, it was just a
mod for the Meditation skill…?” I muttered, looking toward the vent.
Only in my imagination did old Bouhroum actually pop his head out
of the opening and yell, “That’s right!”
A mod—short for “skill modifier”—was a special effect that applied
once a skill’s proficiency reached a certain level. There were other
terms for this concept in other games, like perk or extension, but
they all meant the same thing. It was a major feature, as the decision
128|P

of which mod to use could have a drastically different effect on how
the skill worked for the player.
For example, when I reached proficiency 50 with the one-handed
sword skill, I chose Shorten Sword Skill Cooldown I, and at 100, I
picked Quick Change. I hadn’t used my 150 choice yet, but I was
probably leaning toward Increase Critical Hit Chance I. But one of
those “crittlers” who obsessed over landing critical hits would
probably use up all three mod selections on Increase Critical Hit
Chance I, Increase Critical Hit Chance II, and Increase Critical Hit
Chance III. In this sense, skill mods could encourage vastly different
playstyles, even among players using the same type of weapon.
Pretty much all the other skills had mod selections at proficiency 50,
too. Martial arts, which was classified as an Extra Skill, was no
exception. I powered it up right after gaining it during a period of
collecting upgrade materials and selected Relax Equipment
Conditions, a crucial mod that gave me the ability to activate martial
arts skills with an open hand or legs, even when I had a weapon
equipped in my dominant hand.
But according to the skill tree, there was no mod selection option for
Meditation until you reached proficiency 500. In other words,
because I passed Bouhroum’s trial and earned the Awakening mod
right off the bat, the game system most likely ensured this was
possible by instantly raising my Meditation proficiency to 500.
It seemed ridiculous, but there was no other interpretation.
Wondering what sort of effect a mod that required such a high
proficiency would offer, I tapped the Awakening label and read the
explanatory text that appeared.
Focuses concentration to the extreme and draws out hidden
strength.
“What the hell is this?!” I shouted, all alone on the empty rock.

129|P

It said nothing about the actual concrete effect. I figured I would just
go ahead and use the skill, but there was no USE button. That meant
it wasn’t an active mod like Quick Change but a passive one that
conferred its effect just by having it unlocked. The problem was that
not only did I not know what that effect was, there wasn’t even a
new buff icon next to my HP bar that might tell me. All I knew was
that now I couldn’t take Meditation out of my fifth skill slot. It wasn’t
locked there by the system, of course, but I had a feeling that as soon
as I took it out, that 500 proficiency would go back to 0, and I would
lose the Awakening mod, too.
Perhaps if I sat down to meditate and activated the Meditation skill,
the effect of the Awakening mod would kick in automatically, but I
didn’t have the time to sit around messing with that. Instead, I closed
the window, trying to suppress my irritation. It was around the time
that Asuna might send me a message, but I had to finish the job I’d
been doing before I returned to the castle.
I glanced around the mountaintop, which was much brighter now,
confirmed that there were no other figures or monsters in the
vicinity, and started running along the sheer cliff just to the west.
Since I didn’t have to worry about where I stepped like I had in the
middle of the night, I was able to sprint at full speed. After a minute,
the ground vanished up ahead of me. I put on the brakes so I could
look straight down the cliff. All I saw were the grand carved castle
gates. That meant Castle Galey was surrounded on all sides by sheer
vertical cliffs that even a mountain goat couldn’t climb, and it was
impossible to get inside except through the gates. It seemed
impossible for the forest elves to come over the mountain in a sneak
attack.
With that concern ruled out, I exhaled in relief. That hadn’t
eliminated the possibility that Qusack might be aligned somehow
with Morte’s gang, but if they could only get in through the front
130|P

gate, then as long as I heard the bell first, there was no worry about
waking up to find an intruder with a knife over my bed. We’d
probably see the group of four again in the dining hall, so the next
time we met, I could get them to clear up the issue of why they came
to the frontier so early.
Just as I stretched and began to ponder how I should get back to the
room, a breezy sound effect and its icon alerted me to an incoming
instant message. I hunched my shoulder guiltily and tapped the icon,
bringing up a simple question from my current partner: WHERE ARE
YOU?
A second later, I replied MORNING WALK, BE RIGHT BACK. A glance
around showed that I was currently atop the mountain connected to
the east side of Castle Galey’s gate. But our guest room was in the
west wing, so there was no direct route back. I’d have to circle
around the cylindrical mountain, go back down the triangular roof of
the center building, and onto the rooftops again…
As I pondered this, my eyes traveled down the sheer cliffside again.
Atop the thick gate was a walkway with parapets, which a single dark
elf guard was patrolling now. The drop from where I stood to the
walkway was about six meters, impossible to scale barehanded—but
a jump I could handle with my current stats.
Of course, if a sudden gust caught me, and I missed my landing, I
could plummet to the ground far below to my instant death.
Pointless challenges like this were verboten now in a game where
death was real, but for some reason, I got the feeling that it was a
good idea to test whether or not you could get from the mountain to
the gate walkway while I had the chance. I lined myself up just right
for the attempt.
When the guard was heading farther in the other direction, I jumped.
The walkway was close to two meters wide, so outside of an

131|P

emergency, I didn’t think my judgment would be off. I kept my arms
wide to maintain balance and landed smack in the middle of it.
I didn’t suffer any damage, but I couldn’t prevent the sound, and the
guard heading the other way whirled around. He raced over, long
spear at the ready, so I quickly held up my left hand with the sigil ring
on it.
I wasn’t sure if that was going to do anything, but at any rate, the
guard lowered the spear and asked suspiciously, “What are you
doing here?”
“I’m, uh…on a walk,” I said, repeating my excuse to Asuna, and the
guard seemed to buy it.
“I see. You are free to walk about the castle, but do not impede our
official duties. This gate is the key to Castle Galey’s defense, and we
cannot allow the tiniest mouse to sneak in under our noses.”
“I—I understand, of course,” I said, then asked, “Um…has any foe
ever attacked the castle before?”
“If by foe you mean the forest elves, never. The elves shrivel and
weaken when traveling across those dried sands,” the guard said,
pointing south of the gate. I saw how the canyon, bordered by cliffs
much lower than the one I’d just been atop, continued along for
hundreds of meters, with a bridge of stone that crossed the piles of
white sand on the canyon floor. A new question suddenly occurred
to me.
I turned to the guard and asked, “In that case…who lined up those
stone platforms? Wouldn’t the dark elves who constructed this
castle in the distant past have trouble working in the canyon, too?”
“Ah, you are correct,” he said, turning around to look at the huge
spirit tree that loomed over the inner courtyard of the castle.
“Human swordsman, do you know why that spirit tree has been
living for centuries upon centuries?”
132|P

“Because it’s sucking up the hot water bubbling up from the earth,
right?”
“So you have done your homework,” the guard noted with
satisfaction, his shining black helmet bobbing. He pointed at the
spring around the roots of the tree. “In the distant past, there was a
project to create an aqueduct from the spring that would travel out
of the castle so that more trees could be planted. The idea was that
if trees could take root in that dusty canyon, we might be able to
venture outside the castle. But after just a hundred meters of a
channel from the castle, the spring appeared ready to dry up, and
the project was hastily canceled. The stone looks like a pathway, but
as a matter of fact, it is the remnant of that ancient aqueduct.”
“Ohhh…I had no idea…” I said, noting to myself that though the
hamburg steak had become a “fricatelle,” they still used real-world
distance units. “Thank you for teaching me all these things.”
“It is no matter. In return, I ask only that you offer your protection to
your knight.”
“Well, of course,” I said, leaving his side. I descended the stairs on
the west side of the walkway—this entrance being properly
rectangular, thankfully—and proceeded to the courtyard, where I
raced for the door to the west wing.
I dashed up the nearest staircase and flew into the third-floor guest
room, where I met the gaze of the two women sitting on the sofa.
The moment I smelled the fragrant scent of tea wafting up from the
cups on the table, my stomach grumbled a complaint over the lack of
hamburg steak in it. But now was not the time for that.
“H-hey…good morning, Asuna, Kizmel,” I said with an utterly natural
and pleasant smile. The fencer glared up at me. In a tone of voice
notably cooler than usual, she asked, “Did you enjoy your morning
walk?”

133|P

“Uh, it was…cold. And I got hungry.”
“I’m not surprised. It’s January.”
I could tell she was quite displeased. Fortunately for me, the dark elf
knight threw me a bone.
“Hee-hee…Don’t be so cross, Asuna. It’s in the nature of boys his age
to simply get up and wander off.”
Boys seemed like a mean word to use, but when I considered that I’d
turned fourteen only two months earlier, I might as well be a baby to
the long-lived elves. And from that perspective, my partner didn’t
seem to be that different in age, still a child herself. But she turned
to Kizmel with the smuggest look I’d ever seen and said, “If he was
going on a walk, he could have at least left a note. He’s not a child.”
“Gosh, I’m really sorry about this,” I said, bowing with my hands
pressed together. At last, Asuna’s expression softened. She turned to
me and looked me square in the face this time.
“When I woke up and realized you weren’t in the room, I was
worried. You haven’t forgotten that we’re outside the safe zone,
right?”
The fact that she used the video-game term safe zone in front of
Kizmel and didn’t even realize she did it told me that her concern
was real. I put on a serious look and told her the truth—if only half of
it.
“Sorry, but I was really curious about something, so I went inspecting
the mountain around the castle.”
“Oh…?” Kizmel murmured, more interested in what I had to say than
in the safe-zone term. She lowered her teacup to the table. “You
climbed the outer ring of the castle? How?”
“Um…I raced from the roof here up over the lord’s bedroom…”

134|P

Kizmel’s reaction was much the same as Bouhroum’s. Her eyes
bulged briefly, then she chuckled in a way that I rarely ever heard
from her.
“I see…then you are a more mischievous lad than I took you for,
Kirito. Even Tilnel the tomboy never carried out such a bold plan,
even if she had thought of it.”
“No, really, it wasn’t that special…”
“I don’t think she was complimenting you,” Asuna snapped. My eyes
swiveled back to Kizmel, who was composing herself after all the
chuckles.
“And…what were you looking for on the outer ring?”
“I wasn’t looking for anything specifically…”
I decided that I wasn’t going to tell them what I did find, the
storyteller’s secret hideout, and stuck to my original mission. “I was
just wondering…if the forest elves might climb over that mountain to
attack the castle.”
“Ahhh…I see. I had never considered that possibility…”
“Well, it ended up being wasted effort. The mountain, that ‘outer
ring,’ has a drop of over thirty meters straight down, and no human
or elf could possibly climb it. So I think we can rest easy with that
knowledge today,” I announced.
Asuna blinked several times. “Kirito…you went up there to inspect
the mountain, just for today’s sake?”
“Well, I guess that’s true…”
“I see,” she murmured, then smiled. “Well, in that case, I forgive your
unapproved leave of absence. Now, let’s go get some breakfast.”
“Yes, I agree. And you are the one deciding what we shall do today,
Asuna?” Kizmel confirmed, getting to her feet.
135|P

Asuna patted her on the back. “Of course! Look forward to it!”
All I could hope as I followed them out of the room was that we
weren’t going to spend the day doing a full tour of various baths.
We enjoyed a healthy but fulfilling breakfast of green salad made
with basil-like plants from the courtyard, an omelet mixed with
crushed nuts, a yogurt-y substance with sliced fruit inside, and thin,
crispy toast. But Asuna did not unveil her schedule for the day as we
ate. She really wanted to draw out the suspense until right before we
left.
After the meal, we had tea and went back and forth about ideas (“I
bet we’re doing such and such over at blah-blah-blah.” “Bzzt, wrong
again.”) until, eventually, the four members of Qusack appeared in
the dining hall. They were plodding sleepily along.
When they noticed us and shuffled over, I was inwardly alarmed.
Unlike last night, this time, we had Kizmel at the table. But it would
be unnatural to get up and leave, and we couldn’t simply shoo them
away.
As I waited, praying they wouldn’t start talking about in-game
systems, Gindo’s group sat down right at the table next to us. After a
few moments, I said good morning and introduced Kizmel as “the
dark elf knight adventuring with us.”
Fortunately, Temuo, who seemed the most likely to flip out over this
situation, was half-asleep at the moment, and the introductions
went by without extra comment. Kizmel had told us about the
decoys and fake keys last night, so I thought we’d be safe if the topic
of today’s quest came up in conversation, but just in case, I decided
to bring up a different topic to start things off.
To kill two birds with one stone, I asked Qusack why they came up to
the front-line region so suddenly, when there was very little
information surrounding it at this point.
136|P

Highston’s answer didn’t sound fishy in the least, but it stunned
Asuna and me nonetheless.
“Well, the truth is, we expected to take another three days or so on
Stachion’s series of quests. But we had to call that off for an
unexpected reason…”
“What happened?”
“Wait, you guys don’t know? The central figure of the quest, Lord
Cylon, just up and vanished. It was the night of the first, I think…Ask
any servant at the mansion, and none know where he went, and
there’s no hint about it in the quest log. We just didn’t know what
else to do but move on.”

137|P

AFTER SEEING OFF QUSACK ON THEIR QUEST TO recover the Agate
Key, Asuna and I shared a silent look for a good five seconds.
“……Is the reason Cylon vanished…because Morte’s group killed
him…?”
“……He said it happened the night of the first. It matches the time of
Morte and the dagger user’s ambush. But…is that even possible…? I
would assume that our Cylon is dead, but everyone’s Cylon is still
alive and well at the mansion…” I muttered.
Kizmel looked over, curious. “What are you talking about?”
“Oh, it’s a quest we were doing in Stachion…Or, er, when we say
quest, that’s just a human word, like request or duty…” I explained,
before launching into a brief explanation of the Curse of Stachion.
A murder that took place ten years ago and a missing golden cube.
Lord Cylon hired us to find it, and he made us search an abandoned
home in the nearby town of Suribus. The lord himself showed up
there and paralyzed us—but while on the ride back, loaded into his
carriage, Cylon was abruptly, shockingly murdered…
By the end, Kizmel’s brows were low. She murmured, “So you went
through all of that before arriving here…And the ones who killed this
lord were the brigands who attacked you? You claim they had the
poison needles of the Fallen…”
“That’s right.”
“Then this cannot be overlooked. Asuna,” she said, turning to her
right toward the fencer, “I am very eager to learn how you planned
for us to spend my day of rest, but should we not investigate this
first? To find out how to use the two keys you have acquired.”
“Wh…what?” Asuna blurted out. We were both wide-eyed at this.
138|P

I’d been concerned about the “Curse of Stachion” questline, since
we’d left it hanging, and I wasn’t against the idea of taking this time
to move it further along, but if Kizmel was going to join us, she’d
have to set foot inside the town of Stachion. I opened and closed my
mouth several times before I figured out what to ask the knight.
“Well…your presence with us would give us the strength of a
thousand, but are you sure you want to go walking into a human
town…?”
“It is not as if an elf fails to draw breath within the town limits,
correct? I have never been within one, but there are more than a few
stories of my comrades sneaking into towns out of curiosity or for
some secret mission or another. And before the Great Separation, it
was common for humans and nonhumans to come and go from one
another’s villages. If I wear a hood, they might not even notice my
long ears.”
“Th-that may be true, but…”
Even with your ears hidden, they’ll see the NPC cursor that says DARK
ELF ROYAL GUARD, I thought, sending my partner a look. For some
reason, though, Asuna beamed at Kizmel.
“Yeah, let’s go! As a matter of fact, I was planning to give you a tour
of Stachion today, Kizmel.”
“Wh-whaaat?!” I yelled. “That was your plan…?”
“Technically, the teleport gate in Stachion. The elves’ spirit trees only
start at the third floor, right? So I figured that neither Kizmel nor the
other dark elves have ever seen the first or second floor of Aincrad,”
she said, turning to the woman.
“That is correct. Some elves have explored the Pillar of the Heavens
towers that connect the floors vertically, but only from the third
floor upward. As far as I know, not a single elf has set foot on the first
two floors since ancient times. I will be able to boast to my relatives
139|P

and comrades on the ninth floor that I passed through a human gate
to the first floor. I can even tell Tilnel, whenever we are fated to
meet again…”
Smile never breaking, Asuna reached out and brushed the knight’s
back with her hand. I, too, felt a bit teary over this, but I couldn’t
stop myself from considering the logistics of it all.
There were hundreds of NPCs in Stachion, and the players weren’t
going to go inspecting the cursor name of every last NPC that
wandered through the streets. But that didn’t clear up all of my
concerns. Could an NPC even travel through a teleport gate? Of all
the main towns I’d been through in the game, I had never once seen
an NPC use the gates.
What if the three of us walked through the gate, but Kizmel failed to
travel and was left behind? Well, then Asuna and I could just go right
back. But more seriously…what if some system error caused Kizmel
alone, or even all three of us, to be sent to some random
coordinates? In a worst-case scenario, perhaps Kizmel herself could
be entirely deleted from the system. I couldn’t rule out that
possibility.
“No…wait.”
A sudden idea came to mind, and I opened my window over the
table. In my message inbox, I still had an instant message I received
outside the cave in the fourth area yesterday. I tapped it and used
the REPLY button to send a new question.
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO THROUGH A TELEPORTER WITH AN NPC
IN THE PARTY?
It took Argo the informant no more than thirty seconds to send a
reply to this abbreviated query.

140|P

A QUEST NPC GETS REMOVED FROM THE PARTY. GUARD NPCS
YOU’RE HIRING WITH MONEY STICK WITH YOU. 100C—AND AS A
BONUS, FR ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRD AREA.
So I’d run up my tab again, but at least I got the information I
wanted. In the larger towns were guard barracks and facilities of that
sort, where you could hire bodyguard NPCs for a certain amount of
col per hour. I’d never made use of the service and had hardly ever
seen parties with such NPCs, either, so I simply didn’t know what
happened to those guards when you went through a teleport gate.
Asuna and I weren’t paying Kizmel for her companionship, of course,
but our quest for the hidden key on the sixth floor was already
finished. At this moment, Kizmel was accompanying us of her own
will, so it was hard to tell which of Argo’s two outcomes this fell
under.
At the very least, it seemed that the system was prepared for the
possibility of NPCs stepping into teleport gates, and we wouldn’t
have any accidents with being teleported to random variables or
Kizmel becoming corrupted and deleted. I looked up and interrupted
the women, who were now talking about the ninth floor.
“I’m thinking that Kizmel can use the teleport gate, too. So with that
settled, let’s get going. It’ll take a while for us to get to Stachion from
here…”
“Indeed. I am ready to leave at any time.”
“Me too!”
With my female companions on board, I leaped to my feet and
stuffed the last bit of Asuna’s toast into my mouth, chewing as I
walked. I heard a complaint about my poor manners over my
shoulder and hunched my neck downward. Both Kizmel and the elf
women at the nearby table giggled.

141|P

I expected that the trip from Castle Galey to Stachion would take at
least four hours, no matter how we traveled. Even avoiding battle
wherever possible in the open, the dungeon that separated the first
and second areas was a straight shot with nowhere to hide. The thick
forest that covered the center of the first area was an unmapped
zone, so we’d have to swing far west to travel through Suribus
instead.
But ultimately, despite taking ten minutes for Kizmel to receive
approval to borrow the Greenleaf Cape again, we ended up nearly
halving the four-hour time I expected.
The primary reason was that Kizmel gave us the Droplets of Villi
again, allowing us to walk over the lake to the first area, rather than
going through the tunnel dungeon. The second reason was that
when we approached the forest of the first area, Kizmel regained her
energy with extra to spare, proclaiming that we would go directly
through the woods and then guiding us the whole way. We even
found a small ruin deep in the forest, beat its boss, and got some
treasure—if not for that, it might have only taken an hour and a half,
not two. And the third reason, of course, was having Kizmel’s
tremendous fighting ability on our side.
When the trees started thinning out, and brilliant-white Stachion
appeared in the distance, Asuna marveled, “Wow, straight
ahead…How did you know the way without a map, Kizmel?”
“You should not underestimate my ability, Asuna. We elves are never
lost in a forest.”
“That’s incredible!” she said with delight. On my own, I wondered
cynically if she was accessing the game’s map data. Right on cue, a
scene from yesterday’s adventure replayed in my mind:
In that dungeon housing the Agate Key in the fourth area, we’d been
faced with a sliding puzzle with thirty-five tiles—and Kizmel had

solved the entire thing in a minimum number of moves without even
taking much time to think about it.
This was not something you could explain away as “the brainpower
of an AI.” Traditional computers attempting to solve NP-hard
problems like N × N grid puzzles in the most efficient number of
moves required a vast amount of CPU power. On the other hand, the
SAO system itself generated that puzzle for the dungeon door, so the
system, at least, had to know the quickest solution. What if Kizmel,
without being conscious of it, accessed the system’s stored solution?
The same way that elves could travel the forest without getting lost
because they had the map data there at their fingertips.
Deep in thought, I followed the two women out of the forest, my
head tilting left and right. There was an open field before us, slightly
brown in the winter chill, beyond which lay Stachion with its odd
stepped layout.
Kizmel stretched in the soft sunlight and lowered the hood of her
navy-blue cloak—the precious Greenleaf Cape long ago stashed away
in her pouch. Then she swept the back of her cloak around the front
and tied a rope around the Pagoda Royal Knights emblem so no one
could tell she was a dark elf by appearance alone.
Asuna pulled her own dark-red hood up, which made me want to
join in, but I thought a group of three all hiding their faces would be
suspicious. The main group was out fighting giant frogs and water
bugs in the distant swampland of the third area, so it was unlikely we
would run across anyone we knew in Stachion at this hour.
We cut straight across the field, eventually meeting up with the main
path, and paused just south of the town limits when Kizmel stopped
to gaze up at the white-colored town. “It is beautiful…” she
murmured, “but what an odd place…”

143|P

Asuna and I were used to it by now, but it was indeed true that
Stachion and its uniform construction of fifteen-centimeter blocks
was very strange.
“Are all large human towns built this way?”
“N-no! It’s only this town that’s especially weird,” Asuna quickly
explained. “Remember when we told you about the golden cube
disappearing from the town lord’s mansion? This entire town is
constructed of blocks of wood and stone cut to the exact dimensions
of that cube.”
“Ah…”
“But let’s not stand around and chat here,” Asuna said. “I’m hungry.”
Thanks to Kizmel’s help with the shortcuts, it wasn’t even ten o’clock
yet, but I felt a little hungry, too. I was just thinking that it would be
nice to show Kizmel what human-style cakes were all about before
we got to tackling the curse quest in honest.
I was a bit nervous walking through the gate, but nothing about
Kizmel changed after the SAFE HAVEN sign appeared in my vision as
we crossed the boundary. She didn’t seem to see the same visual
marker as us. I recalled that she must have snuck into Zumfut on the
third floor, too.
There were more than a few players on the wide main street of
town, but most were just tourists coming up from the lower floors to
check it out. As I expected, nobody stopped to examine Kizmel’s
yellow cursor. Relieved and relaxed, I suggested, “Should we stop for
some tea nearby? We can spend the rest of the morning
investigating the lord’s disappearance, and then we can take the
teleport gate down after noon.”
“Agreed!”
“I believe that will be acceptable,” Kizmel added.

144|P

So I steered us toward a restaurant with an ample sweets menu not
far from the southern gate. We turned west off the main road and
down a smaller one. After a while, Kizmel came to a stop and rubbed
one of the dark-brown wood blocks used for the buildings.
“…You cut the trees down to this size and then stack them up
again…Humans do the strangest things…”
Asuna and I shared a look. The elves—dark elves, forest elves, even
the fallen elves—would never cut down a living tree. If they used any
wood in their buildings and furniture, it would only come from trees
that had fallen at the end of their life span.
In that sense, the lower part of Stachion on the south side was
perhaps the biggest waste of wood in any major human town.
Maybe this wasn’t the best place to have chosen as a destination.
But despite my concern, Kizmel just gave us a glance and blinked in
surprise.
“Oh, I am not complaining,” she said, smiling. “Elves have their way
of life, as do humans. The old me…in fact, all dark elves, since the
long distant past, have scorned other races as foolish and below us,
but since meeting you, and accompanying you at times, I have
learned that humankind possesses many virtues as well. For one
thing, we first met when you saved my life from the forest elf who
was about to defeat me. I suppose having my life saved by humans is
bound to change my mind…”
Asuna and I shared another glance, then looked bashful. When we
saw the two elf knights fighting in the woods, the biggest reason that
I chose Kizmel over the Forest Elven Hallowed Knight was because it
was what I did in the beta. I just picked the familiar route.
So why did I choose her in the beta? At the time, I wasn’t a solo
player but was hanging around in a four-person party of strangers, so
it wasn’t my decision alone, but no one else had protested, and I

145|P

seem to remember that we reached the consensus in just a matter of
seconds.
Perhaps it was because the other three were also guys, and Kizmel
was a beautiful older woman. But it was often the case in other
games and novels that the dark elves were antagonists. The forest elf
looked every bit the heroic, shining knight, and we could have cast
our allegiance with him for that reason.
Had I felt something in that moment, besides the fact that Kizmel
was a woman?
“Um, Kizmel,” Asuna mumbled, stepping closer to the knight, “the
truth is, when we stepped in to help you on the third floor…”
I briefly panicked, unsure of what she was about to say, but there
was no chance to step in or hear the rest—because Kizmel grabbed
Asuna’s shoulders and pulled her closer, while looking over my
shoulder and shouting, “Who goes there?!”
The tone of alarm in her voice made me spin around to look.
There was no one in the three-meter-wide street. We weren’t in the
shopping area, so the only buildings lining the road were homes with
their doors shut tight. I looked about but saw no hint of green,
yellow, or even (impossible in this place) orange cursors…
But just then, a small silhouette practically melted out of the
shadows of a building. It was dressed in a full gray hooded cloak,
hiding its identity. The cursor over its head was yellow, indicating an
NPC.
Kizmel promptly grabbed the hilt of her saber, and I reached
backward for the sword over my shoulder. However, the figure
shook its head and, just loud enough to hear, said, “I mean you no
harm.”

146|P

The voice belonged to a very young girl—and it was familiar
somehow.
Where had I heard it, I wondered…but could not arrive at an answer.
The name under the cursor was MYIA, but that did not immediately
ring a bell for me, either…
Kizmel repeated her question. “Who are you? Why were you
following us?”
She had her own black hood pulled low, so in clothing, the two
looked very similar, except for the issue of height. Kizmel was a fair
bit taller than me, but the gray-cloaked woman across from us
seemed more the size of a child.
“I merely wish to speak with that swordsman over there,” the NPC
said, pointing at my face with a skinny hand.
“Huh…? Me?”
“Sir Swordsman, do you have one of these?” she said, opening her
hand to reveal a small key hanging from a little string. Now, this item
I recognized.
“Kirito, isn’t that…?” Asuna whispered, and I nodded. I opened up my
inventory and materialized the same item that I’d just gotten three
days earlier. It was the iron key, one of two that dropped when
Morte killed Cylon.
I lifted the key up, which also was strung on a little loop, closed my
game window, and let it dangle like the NPC girl was doing.
Then something very strange happened. The completely ordinary
gray key began to thrum with a faint ringing, vibrating gently. Across
from me, the NPC’s key was exhibiting the same reaction.
“…Who are you? And what does that key do…?” I asked. The graycloaked NPC stashed away the key and approached. Kizmel kept her
hand on the hilt of the saber but did not draw it.
147|P

“As long as we have these keys, we are not safe, even in town. Let’s
go somewhere else,” said the NPC named Myia. I shared a look with
Asuna and Kizmel. We couldn’t discount the possibility of a trap. But
we had come to this town to investigate the mystery of Cylon’s two
keys, and here was a major clue, so there was no point backing away
now.
“All right,” said Asuna. “Where should we go, then?”
The NPC nodded, glanced around, and whispered, “Follow me.” We
followed the cloaked woman to the western end of the south half of
Stachion, where the construction was the most dense. She used yet
another key, one colored bronze, to open the door to a small house
there, ushered us inside, then peered around outside to make sure
the coast was clear before shutting and locking the door again.
There was a living room at the end of a short hallway. Despite it
having just passed ten in the morning, it was quite dark inside. The
shutters were down over the largest window, so the sunlight could
only get in through the few smaller windows around the room. The
NPC lit a lamp hanging on the wall, then turned around to apologize.
“I’m sorry that I can’t open the window for you. Hang on, I’ll put on
some tea,” she said, heading for the kitchen, but Asuna pulled her
back.
“No, there’s no need. Please, tell us what you have to say.”
“…Oh. I see.”
The NPC paused, then motioned to the sofa in the middle of the
living room, so the three of us sat down on it. She took an armchair
across from us and lowered her hood.
Asuna gasped. I felt stunned, too. Based on her height, I assumed the
woman was very young, but seeing her features in the light now, she
was actually just a child—perhaps no more than ten years old. Just in

148|P

case, I glanced at the ears under her neatly bobbed blond hair, but
she was not an elf.
“My name is Mee-a,” she said, and all of a sudden, I understood how
the name Myia was meant to be pronounced. It was a simple name
but somehow mysterious.
“I am Kizmel, a knight,” said the elf, who kept her hood on. Asuna
and I followed her lead.
“I’m Kirito…a swordsman, I guess.”
“And I am Asuna. I’m a swordswoman.”
“Kizmel, Kirito…and Asuna. Do I have that right?” she asked, using
the familiar NPC routine for checking pronunciation. She looked right
at me with grayish-green eyes. “Kirito, the iron key that you possess
came from Lord Cylon of Stachion, correct?”
“Y…yes,” I agreed, then realized I might be creating a dangerous
mistaken impression. “Oh, b-but I didn’t take it from him by force.
Technically, I, uh…picked it up off the ground…” I stammered.
Asuna calmly asked, “Myia, do you…know what happened to Cylon?”
“……Yes.” The girl nodded, her long-lashed eyes downcast. “I heard
from Terro, the gardener at the mansion. Cylon…my father was
attacked by brigands outside of town three nights ago and died…”
…Gardener?
…Father?
The two words collided in my brain, and it took a while for them to
fall into the proper places.
The only ones who knew Cylon was dead were me, Asuna, Kizmel,
Morte and the dagger user, and the large NPC man who served
Cylon. That would mean the large man who rode off in the carriage
was the gardener named Terro.

149|P

That was all well and good…but the girl also called Cylon her father.
Taken at face value, it would mean she was the daughter of the late
lord.
The morning after Morte’s attack, Asuna asked me if Cylon had any
family, and I said that I didn’t recall any wife or children at his
mansion. I had never seen Cylon’s family in the beta or this time
around, but that wasn’t proof that Cylon had no family at all.
“Myia…you’re Cylon’s daughter?” Asuna asked, getting to the root of
everything I was thinking. Myia acknowledged she was. Asuna
hesitated for a brief moment before she offered, “I…I’m sorry, Myia.
We were present when those brigands attacked your father. In fact,
the truth is, the bandits were after Kirito and me. Cylon was just a
victim…”
I felt as though my head were splitting in two. Myia was an NPC, and
the conversations with her had to be a part of the “Curse of
Stachion” quest. But Morte killed Cylon, and he was a player—it was
a spontaneous event, not a programmed step of the quest’s story.
How was it that in just three days, it had been incorporated into the
quest scenario? I was certain that after we saw Cylon die, another
identical Cylon would pop up in Stachion, so that the quest
proceeded for all other players regardless…
“You don’t need to apologize for that,” Myia said, mature beyond
her years. I lifted my head. “I heard about everything from Terro.
How Father gave you poison and abducted you…and was going to
lock you in the maze beneath the mansion, forcing you to perform
the duty, no, the atonement he was meant to bear…”
“Atonement…” I repeated without realizing it. Myia turned her
mysterious green eyes on me. I summoned my courage and asked
the NPC girl, “Do you know…what your father did…?”

150|P

“……Yes,” Myia said, looking down. “Mother told me everything the
other day.”
“M-Mother…?” I parroted back again. Myia’s mother would have to
be Cylon’s wife, I assumed, when Asuna jabbed my arm with her
elbow. The shock helped my synapses finally fire properly. I had
already explained, to Asuna no less, that Cylon had a lover ten years
ago.
“Um…Does that mean your mother is the previous lord’s app…I
mean, servant…?” I said, nearly saying the word apprentice by
mistake, based on my knowledge from the beta. Fortunately, Myia
didn’t seem to notice or find it suspicious.
“Yes,” she said, “my mother’s name is Theano, and I’ve heard that
she served Pithagrus, the previous lord of Stachion, until ten years
ago.”
Theano.
I met her four months ago, during the SAO beta test. But she left a
strong impression, and if I closed my eyes, I could summon the image
of her handsome face right away. If I tried, I could see some of those
details in Myia’s features, too.
In the “Curse of Stachion” quest, on the correct route—well, at this
point there was no telling what was correct, so let’s call it the beta
route—I was paralyzed by Cylon in the house in Suribus, stuffed in a
bag and taken back to Stachion, then saved in the backstreets by
none other than Theano.
She was once a servant at the lord’s mansion, a puzzle expert who
earned Pithagrus’s admiration, as well as a skilled fighter with the
sword. One night ten years ago, she witnessed a furious Cylon
bludgeon Pithagrus to death with a golden cube.
She should have told a guard at once, but after much anguish,
Theano decided to keep her silence. This was because Cylon was also
151|P

her lover, and while Cylon killed Pithagrus for not naming him as the
successor, in fact, Pithagrus’s plan was to name the next lord of the
town the person he was secretly training: Theano. When Cylon left
the room, she slipped in and took the bloody cube, then locked it in
the deepest part of the Dungeon of Trials beneath the mansion. She
then placed the key to open the dungeon in the hideout in Suribus
and quit her job as servant.
Theano hoped that Cylon would regret his sin and reveal all that he
had done to her. Only then did she plan to tell Cylon where to find
the key. But Cylon claimed the body, whose face was crushed
beyond recognition, belonged to a nameless traveler and that it was
Pithagrus who killed the traveler. The result was a curse of puzzles
that befell Stachion—and was steadily expanding beyond the town
to this day.
In the beta test, Theano and I snuck into the mansion, convinced
Cylon to see the error of his ways, and used the golden key to go into
the dungeon beneath the building. The three of us completed many
puzzles and blazed through the astral-type monsters that shouldn’t
have appeared there, until we reached the end of the dungeon.
There, we beat Pithagrus’s vengeful ghost in a puzzle battle,
retrieved the cube, purified it with holy water, then offered it to the
grave of the traveler (actually Pithagrus). Then his ghost appeared
again and forgave Cylon, bringing the story full circle.
But this time, Cylon couldn’t atone for his sin and undo the curse,
because he got killed by Morte the PKer. This event, which should
have only affected the quest for Asuna and me, somehow now
applied to all players. Cylon had seemingly vanished off the face of
Aincrad altogether.
There was no longer a way to complete the quest in the same order
of events that I used in the beta. I had the golden key in my
possession, so we might be able to get into the dungeon and retrieve
152|P

the cube, but would that alone undo Pithagrus’s curse? And why
weren’t we being visited by the crucial Theano herself, but by her
daughter Myia?
“Theano…Where is your mother now…?” I asked gingerly. The girl’s
lips pursed, and she shook her head. She pulled the iron key out of
her shirt and stared at it.
“…I don’t know. The morning after she learned that Father had been
killed, she left a note and this key behind and vanished.”
“What did the note say?”
“It had an apology to me, the truth of the traveler’s murder at the
mansion ten years ago, and a reminder to visit Barro if she never
came back…”
“Who’s Barro…?” I asked, thinking that name sounded familiar, too.
To my surprise, it was Asuna rather than Myia who answered.
“The gardener at the mansion at the time Theano worked there.
Remember, we talked to him three days ago?”
“Oh y-yeah…” I mumbled.
Myia nodded and explained, “Barro is the father of Terro, who tends
the gardens now. Ten years ago, my father killed Pithagrus, the
previous lord…although he made it sound as though a traveler was
killed, and Pithagrus went missing. After that, many of the servants
left their jobs there, including my mother and Barro. But Terro was
having trouble learning his words, and they said he wouldn’t be able
to support himself in town, so my father, the new lord Cylon, agreed
to take him in.”
“…Oh, I see…” I said, recalling the silence and obedience of the large
man who showed up at the secret hideout. It seemed like perhaps
Cylon wasn’t utterly evil to his core after all. I sighed.

153|P

A heavy silence settled upon the scene. It was broken by the soft
voice of Kizmel.
“Myia. You said that as long as we had the key, we were not safe in
town. Why is that?”
That was a curious point, it was true, but more interesting and nervewracking to me was that two NPCs were interacting in a way that
could not have been pre-scripted into the story. I wondered if they
would actually hold a logical conversation, when…
“The night that Mother left this key and letter behind, a thief broke
into the house where we lived for years, right near the town square. I
was awoken by the sound and went into the living room, where a
brigand dressed in black was holding this key and drew his dagger to
attack when he saw me…I managed to fight him off and take back
the key, but I realized it was dangerous to remain in the house, and
so I moved here as soon as I could.”
“Oh? Whose house is this?”
“My father’s. This is where Lord Cylon lived before he went to dwell
in the mansion as Lord Pithagrus’s apprentice. My father never
returned, but my mother would bring me here to clean the place
every once in a while.”
“I see,” Kizmel said, crossing her arms. “So the brigand does not
know about this house yet.”
Next to her, I hummed to myself. I see. So this is the original home
of Cylon. If we look around, we might find some clues to—no, wait.
Before that. Didn’t Myia say something odd?
“W-wait just a moment, Myia. You said that a thief with a dagger
came to steal your key…Did you fight him off by yourself?” Asuna
asked while I was trying to recall just what she had said.

154|P

But yes, that was the part. Myia had said she had fought him off, but
how could a girl of only ten years or so do such a thing?
With new eyes, I stared at the bob-haired girl. Even with the gray
cloak on, it was clear at a glance that she was incredibly thin. Resting
atop her knees, her hands looked like a doll’s. Could she even swing
a knife, much less a sword?
Myia nodded to Asuna and said, without changing expression, “Yes,
from a very young age, my mother…”
But we didn’t get to hear the end of that. There was a loud, hard
crash, and a small window at the back end of the living room
shattered.
“What was that?!” I shouted, rising to my feet. Bouncing our way
along the ground was a black sphere. As soon as she saw the
baseball-sized object, Kizmel shouted, “Everyone, hold your breath!”
I sucked in as much air as my lungs could handle and closed my
mouth. The ball split in two and began to emit a thick purple smoke.
Not more poison gas! I swore in my head, drawing the Sword of
Eventide +3 from my back. I didn’t know what kind of poison it was,
but no events of this nature were going to end with just the gas.
At my side, Asuna had her window open, materializing a masklike
object. The leather-made item was the gas mask that Cylon dropped
when he died. I thought she was going to put it on herself, but
instead, she leaped over the table and stuck it over Myia’s face.
More glass broke. This time, the large double windows shattered,
shutters and all, and two dark figures leaped into the room. They
tumbled smoothly over the floor and popped to their feet, drawing
short, curved blades in unison. The cursors above their heads were
yellow, the text reading UNKNOWN BURGLAR. They were NPCs, not
players.

155|P

As soon as the blades pointed our way glinted like razors, I finally
remembered that we were inside town. This was a quest-event
battle (I assumed), but this house was within the Anti-Criminal-Code
safe haven of town. No monsters could get inside the zone, and
players’ HP were protected from harm and would not lose a single
pixel, no matter what. That was one of the ironclad rules of SAO, as I
understood it.
But wait…
A player attacking a player was a crime, but would it be a crime if an
NPC acting according to the story attacked a player? I’d never
experienced this for myself. Was it possible that if a story battle
occurred within town, the safety code might not actually protect us?
I wanted to shout to Asuna and Myia to get back, but I couldn’t do
that with my breath held. The purple smoke, half-translucent, was
already up to face level, and as soon as I breathed it in, I was going to
suffer some kind of debuff. If the code didn’t work, and I took
continuous damage, for example, I could chug potions to stay safe,
but if this was paralyzing poison again, I had no means of
counteracting it. I gave a hand signal, hoping the message got across,
and held up my sword.
Just to my right was Kizmel, saber drawn. She had that ultrarare
antidote ring on, but that didn’t mean much in the midst of a gas.
The black-clad attackers had their faces entirely wrapped in cloth,
plus they had gas masks on that were different from Cylon’s, hiding
their features from view. They held up their gleaming curved
blades—but failed to attack.
They simply didn’t need to: We would run out of breath in just thirty
or forty seconds.
In other words, we had to eliminate our enemies in that time frame.

156|P

Kizmel and I made the briefest of eye contact before charging
together. The black-masked burglars leaped, too, a split-second later.
The instant our blades crossed, the enemy cursors turned to brilliant
red. Even for me, at level 20, the color looked dark. The power they
exhibited was about the same as the deadly Forest Elven Inferior
Knight at Yofel Castle on the fourth floor.
I gritted my teeth and pushed hard against the enemy, but my breath
was already running out. Sparks were flying from Kizmel’s saber
where she pushed, too, but even the elite knight’s arm strength was
not enough to bowl back this foe. We had to break the stalemate
somehow, before the poison got us……
“Kirito, Kizmel, pull inward!” shouted a brave-yet-young voice from
behind us. I leaned to my right and saw a bright-red flash shoot past
my left side.
Kra-ka-kam! went a series of shocks, and the brigand in black flew
backward, bearing three damage-effect lines on his chest. A moment
later, Kizmel’s opponent suffered the same fate and slammed against
the far wall.
It was Asuna who had helped Kizmel out, and my own rescuer
was…Myia. Like Asuna, she used the three-part rapier thrust skill,
Triangular.
Stunned, I looked down at the masked girl and her short but fancylooking rapier. But not for long—we couldn’t let this opportunity
pass. Kizmel and I bounded forward to deliver the finishing blows to
our tumbling foes.
But the burglars each put a hand to their waists, pulled something
from their belts, and threw. I just managed to deflect it with my
sword, but they used the opportunity to stand and essentially
backflip out through the broken window.

157|P

Their footsteps rapidly scurried away. You’re not going anywhere! I
thought, leaping through the window to the backyard. With fresh air
finally flooding into my lungs, I swept through the wooden gate and
looked left and right, but there were no people in the midday back
alley—and no red cursors.

158|P

159|P

“…They got away,” said a voice behind me. I spun around to see the
dark elf knight looking severe. I nodded to her and went back into
the yard, pulling the wooden gate shut.
“They were pretty tough—and speedy, too,” I said. “It’s a good thing
you were with us, Kizmel. Of course, I’m sorry—you didn’t sign up for
all this.”
But she did not change her expression. “That might not be entirely
true.”
“Huh…?”
The Curse of Stachion was an incident that happened entirely
between humans and had no relation to the elves at all, I wanted to
protest—until Kizmel thrust a long, narrow object toward my face. It
looked like the throwing picks the burglars threw as they escaped,
but when my gaze brought it into focus, my jaw dropped.
Held between her fingers was a wicked poison needle with a spiral
hexagonal shape: a Spine of Shmargor.
At first, I wondered if the masked attackers were none other than
Morte and his dagger-using friend. But that was impossible, of
course. Their cursors were as yellow as Kizmel’s before they turned
red, and if they were players, they would turn orange, rather than
red.
But then, who were they…?
“I recognized the thin crescent blades they used,” she said softly.
“Those are the weapons of the Fallen’s assassins.”
“……You mean the fallen elves?” I asked, perhaps unnecessarily.
The elf knight arched an eyebrow. “Gather your wits, Kirito. Have you
ever heard of fallen goblins or fallen orcs in Aincrad?”

160|P

Actually, I would prefer those, I thought to myself. “Er…right. Of
course. But…what are fallen elves doing here? The elves have
nothing to do with this que…this incident…”
“Yes, indeed. It’s possible I was followed leaving Castle Galey, but in
that case, they could have attacked us in the wilderness or forest at
any time, rather than waiting until we entered this human town,”
Kizmel pointed out.
She was absolutely right about that. Which meant the target was…
I spun around, just as Asuna and Myia emerged from the back door
to the right of the broken windows. Asuna was in maximum alert
mode, surveying the area with her Chivalric Rapier in hand, while
Myia still wore her gas mask. The rapier she’d used to execute a
Triangular was now encased in its sheath, hung on the inside of her
gray cloak.
The girl trotted over, remarkably calm in the immediate aftermath of
the dramatic attack. She seemed to have heard the conversation
between Kizmel and me, and when she spoke, her voice was muffled
by the mask, but not enough to be indecipherable.
“They were dressed the exact same way as the thieves who snuck
into my house two days ago. Like the last time, I think they were
after my mother’s key.”
“…I…I see…”
In other words, this girl of no more than ten fought off not typical
burglars, but fallen elf spies or assassins of some kind, all by herself.
After witnessing how her sword skill was just as sharp as Asuna’s…I
still had a hard time buying it. She couldn’t be more than a year or
two older than poor sickly Agatha, whose quest I completed to earn
the Anneal Blade back on the first floor.
But something was more important right now than solving that
mystery. I took the iron key out of my waist pouch and held it up at
161|P

the height of Myia’s leather gas mask. The key around her neck
reacted, the two resonating faintly.
I asked, “Myia, what are these keys? Do you know where they’re
supposed to be used…?”
“No,” she said, shaking her head. “All my mother’s letter said was
that it was a memento of her time with Father, so she wanted me to
take good care of it. If she knew that dangerous people would come
after it, I don’t think she would have left it in my care.”
“I see…”
This appeared to suggest that we wouldn’t know the truth until we
found the missing Theano. Kizmel bent down and said to the girl,
“Myia, how did you find us? You were following us before I detected
you in the alley, weren’t you?”
“Yes…I’m sorry for having done that, but I wanted to make sure you
weren’t with the burglars…”
“No, I am not blaming you,” Kizmel said kindly. “It only makes sense
that you would do this, considering the circumstances.”
The girl in the gas mask nodded and pressed her tiny hand over her
chest. “The key my mother left me and the key that Kirito holds,
belonging to my father, are drawn to each other. Even when
separated by great distances, they always vibrate faintly, trying to
point to the other.”
“Huh? Really…?”
I shifted the height and angle of the key I held to point directly at the
key hanging from Myia’s neck. Indeed, the key vibrated subtly at the
end of its string. Myia twitched, feeling the same sensation from her
key.
So the keys used vibration to indicate direction and sound resonance
to indicate distance to each other. Once you knew that, it wouldn’t
162|P

be hard to find us, even in the crowded, complex interior of Stachion.
Still, that didn’t answer the question of what locks these keys were
meant to open—and why the unrelated fallen elves would want to
steal them.
As I stared at the fine detail of the key Cylon left behind, Asuna, who
still had a hand on Myia’s shoulder, seemed to figure something out.
“Say, Kirito…does the golden key we found at the hideout in Suribus
react to the iron key at all?”
“Huh? Oh, I don’t know…”
I opened my window and pulled the golden key out of the KEY ITEMS
tab and checked my quest log, too, just in case, but the latest hint
hadn’t updated yet: LORD CYLON OF STACHION HAS BEEN KILLED BY
THIEVES. YOU MUST FIND THE RIGHT PLACE TO USE THE KEYS HE
LEFT BEHIND.
Ignoring the question of who actually wrote that synopsis, I closed
the window and hung the iron key from my right hand. The golden
key didn’t have a string, so I held it directly in my left hand and
pointed them at each other, moving them closer and farther apart,
but they produced no vibration or sounds.
But on closer inspection, they were very similar outside of the color.
The keys in Aincrad were all old-fashioned ward-lock keys, in keeping
with the medieval fantasy style, so while they all kind of looked alike,
I could see many shared elements in the head design and teeth of
these keys.
“Is that…?” prompted a soft voice, and I looked up from my
examination. Myia had taken a step forward and was looking closely
at the golden key through her mask. “Is that golden key the same
one that my mother took from the mansion ten years ago?”
“Uh…yes, I think so. We found it at Pithagrus’s hideout in the town of
Suribus.”
163|P

“Then maybe,” Myia said, looking briefly gloomy, “maybe my mother
went to search for that key.”
“Huh…?” I grunted.
But Asuna seemed to understand. “Yes, I think that’s possible. Terro
the gardener was following Cylon’s orders, but while he knew he was
supposed to paralyze us and locked us in the dungeon beneath the
mansion, I don’t think he actually knew the purpose of that mission.
So I don’t think that he would’ve been able to explain what
happened to the golden key to Theano…”
“Yes, when Terro visited the night before Mother disappeared, I was
there, too. But he didn’t mention anything about a key.”
“So…did Theano go to the hideout in Suribus? But the basement
dungeon won’t open without this key, so she would have known the
key was removed. After Cylon was killed, only the brigands and our
group could have the key…so has she been searching for us for the
past three days…?” I wondered.
Kizmel said, “No, that is not probable. The one with the golden key
would likely have an iron key, and Theano knew that the two iron
keys reacted, so if she wanted to find the current holder, she
wouldn’t leave her own iron key at home like that.”
“Oh…yeah. Good point…”
Trying to find the other keyholder without bringing her own key
would be like trying to find the seven somethingballs without the soand-so radar. So where was Theano, then…?
“Think carefully, Kirito,” Kizmel said, like a big sister or teacher. I
gaped. “Huh? About what?”
“A key does nothing on its own. For a key to be stolen, there must be
a place where it is used.”

164|P

“Oh…I—I get it now,” I mumbled, looking to the northern sky. Over
the roofs of the wood-block houses lining the little alley, the chalkwhite mansion could be seen at the far north end of town.
After she heard the story from Terro, Theano must have deduced
that the purpose of the brigands who attacked Cylon was to steal the
golden key. Of course, Morte’s real aim was not the key, but our
lives; yet, there was no way Theano could have known that.
If she was looking for the brigands who stole the golden key, she
wouldn’t need the iron key, and in the low probability that different
people had the golden and iron keys, it would be a waste of time.
More importantly, as Kizmel said, a far better choice would be to
stake out the place where the brigands would need to use that key.
When we fought together in the beta, Theano was a clever and
patient warrior. It was quite possible that she was hiding out near
the entrance to the basement dungeon for the thieves to arrive.
Unfortunately, that was the biggest waste of time of them all. I still
had the golden key, and Morte’s gang seemed to have no interest in
keys or cubes.
“…If Theano’s at the mansion, we should go find her and explain the
situation…” I suggested. Kizmel and Asuna agreed, but Myia said
nothing.
A few seconds later, her masked face rose, and as quietly as was still
audible, she said, “Kirito, Asuna…My father deceived you, poisoned
and abducted you, and hoped to force a dangerous duty upon you.
Evil acts only beget more evil…It was divine punishment when he
was attacked and killed by those brigands. If my mother is trying to
avenge his death, you have no obligation to help her. I only wanted
to warn you of the danger around…so why are you going to these
lengths?”
“Um…well…”

165|P

Her question was perfectly reasonable, but I had no answer. Theano
had saved me—but only in the beta test. She didn’t know my name
or face in this version of the world, so she had no reason to help
avenge the death of Cylon, who had paralyzed Asuna and me and
stuffed us into sacks. The “Curse of Stachion” quest was still ongoing,
of course, but Myia wouldn’t understand what that was, and I was
rapidly losing interest in whatever the “correct” route for this quest
was.
I just didn’t know how to actually explain all this. But luckily, instead,
Asuna circled around Myia’s front and bent down. “It’s not about
logic or reason. You tried to warn us about the danger we were in. If
you’re in trouble, too, then of course we’ll help. You’re worried
about your mother, aren’t you?”
“……”
Myia said nothing for many seconds, before finally nodding her head.
“…Yes. Um…thank you, Asuna, Kirito, and Kizmel.”
“It is no matter. I have my own meaningful connection to those ones
who attacked us, too,” said Kizmel with a smile. Then she asked,
“But, Myia, how long are you going to continue wearing that mask?
The poison is long gone.”
“Oh…uhhh…” Myia lifted her hands up to the side of the mask before
turning to look at Asuna. “Um, do you mind if I borrow this mask just
a bit longer?”
“Huh…? It’s all right, of course. But isn’t it stuffy?”
“I’m fine. I feel more secure when I have this on.”
“Oh…”
Asuna looked skeptical still—but then she froze. I understood what
she was thinking. The gas mask Myia had on belonged to Cylon.
They’d been apart for ten years—possibly she had never actually met
166|P

him—but now the young girl was able to smell her father in that
mask. If it put her at peace, how could we demand she take it off?
Even if it meant the pretty young swordgirl’s looks were diminished.
My partner straightened up again and put her hand on Myia’s back.
“In that case, let’s go to the lord’s mansion together. I bet we’ll find
your mother there.”
“Okay!” Myia said brightly.
Just then, a fourth HP bar appeared under the three already present
in the upper-left corner of my view. When I saw the little number
next to the name MYIA, I very nearly shouted “Whuzmeen?!”—an
abbreviation of “What does that mean?”
Currently, my level was 20, and Asuna’s was 19. After splitting off on
the fifth floor, Kizmel passed us to reach 21—and Myia’s level was
23.
Kizmel was an elite-class NPC whose stats were higher than other
NPCs or monsters of her same level, so the comparison wasn’t direct,
but at the very least, this meant Myia had battle power to match
Kizmel’s.
I’m glad she didn’t suspect me of killing Cylon, I thought. In fact, at
this rate, we’re going to end up with more NPCs than party members
soon.
Feeling a bit awkward and self-conscious, I trudged through the gate
into the alley.

167|P

UNFORTUNATELY, WE DID NOT FIND THEANO UNDERNEATH the
lord’s mansion.
And she was not the only one we missed. There was something
else—not a person but an object—that was incredibly important but
gone from the building.
Because Lord Cylon was dead—or missing, as the official word went
for now—most of the servants were gone, and the mansion greeted
us in a desolately quiet state. Our party of four headed first to the
entrance of the dungeon on the second basement floor, but Theano
was not there, and the marble door was shut tight, so we went
outside to look for Terro the gardener.
When we found him in the corner of the yard, Terro refused to
answer any of our questions, claiming he didn’t know or
understand—and it wasn’t clear if he even remembered Asuna and
me or not. But when Myia, still wearing the gas mask, demanded he
explain what he was hiding, the big man spilled the beans at once.
The day after Cylon’s death—the morning of January 2— Theano
showed up out of nowhere and got Terro to help her open the secret
back door to the underground maze. This time, I did not hold back
from shouting “Th’ellman?!”—a contraction of “What the hell,
man?”
A back door. If that existed, then the key to get into the dungeon was
completely pointless. Cylon could have just gone in there and
whisked out the golden cube himself. I was so stunned that I fell into
a sitting position with my arms around my knees.
Asuna knelt down to whisper in my ear, “Don’t dungeons usually
have some hidden passageway or door in the very last room that you
can use to get out?”

168|P

The fencer hadn’t really played an RPG before being trapped in SAO,
so if even she was calling me out with basic knowledge like this, I had
to suck it up. And upon closer reflection, only a person who had been
through the dungeon before would know about the secret back
door, and given that this was under the mansion, that would leave
only Pithagrus and Theano; and the former was dead. I’d been
through it in the beta, but I recalled being teleported back to the
entrance after I got the golden cube.
Thinking back on it, there were very frequent uses of teleportation in
the beta outside of teleport gates and activation of the antiharassment code—but it seemed like nearly all of them were
removed in the final release. Including, of course, teleporting to
Blackiron Palace when you died.
It was with this in mind that I stood up, composed myself, and
allowed Terro to lead us to the dungeon’s back door. The large man
used his considerable strength to shift the entire base of a stone
statue in a corner of the yard, revealing a staircase below. The four
of us filed through into the final chamber of the dungeon, bypassing
all the puzzles and ghosts and boss monsters in the process.
As I expected, there was no sign of a bloodied golden cube or Myia’s
mother, Theano. We left the mansion without much to show for it
and came to a stop about ten meters from its stately gates. Silence
dominated the group.
“…Shall we just find a quiet place where we can reexamine the
situation?” Asuna suggested, to Kizmel’s and Myia’s agreement. I
was with them, of course, but I knew that two players and two NPCs,
three of us hooded, would attract attention, and we’d already been
attacked inside a locked house, so there probably wasn’t anywhere
safe to go inside the town.

169|P

“…You know, maybe the open terrace seats along the main road with
all its traffic are less likely to get us attacked…” I proposed, thinking
we should just accept the visibility and focus on safety.
But before Asuna could say anything, it was Kizmel who said, “Do
you—and Myia—still have any reason to be in this town?”
“Huh…?” Asuna and I shared a look, then went back to Kizmel.
We did have plans here. After we did what we could about the quest,
we were going to use Stachion’s teleport gate to visit the first floor
and show Kizmel the Town of Beginnings. But in this situation, we’d
have to be prepared for an attack while sightseeing—and was it right
to drag Myia along with us?
“Well…um…” I stammered, which was all Kizmel needed to hear. I
could see her smiling under the deep hood.
She turned to my partner and said, “Asuna, I am very touched to
learn that you planned many things for us to do together. But I
cannot ignore Myia and her Fallen attackers and go on a sightseeing
vacation. The old me might not have cared at all about the squabbles
of humankind…but much as you two saved me, now I wish to save
Myia.”
Asuna closed her eyes slowly and opened them again with a smile
that was breathtakingly gentle, even loving. “Our plans can wait. We
have all the time in the world. I can set up something else once
we’ve solved all these problems. And both Kirito and I aren’t in any
mood to abandon Myia, either.”
She rested her hand on Myia’s shoulder. I was sure that Asuna had
seen the girl’s level, but she didn’t seem to be viewing the situation
through that particular lens. And for Myia’s part, she didn’t hold her
own considerable skill in any kind of high esteem.

170|P

She bowed deeply to us. “Thank you…I cannot imagine where my
mother is now or what she is doing. Please, I would appreciate your
help.”
“But of course,” Kizmel said at once, before looking to me. “Now, I
have a suggestion…Why don’t we take Myia back to the castle?
There is no concern of the Fallen attacking her there, and we will find
plenty of places to relax and speak openly.”
“Whaaat?!” I yelped.
But it was true: If the Anti-Criminal Code wasn’t going to help us
now, then no place could be safer for us than Castle Galey. The only
issue was whether Myia would agree to leave her home of Stachion
and travel that far…
So I explained about Castle Galey to Myia. Behind the ports of the
gas mask, her eyes were big and sparkling. In a rush, the words came
tumbling out.
“Of course I want to go see an elf castle.”
We left Stachion, taking the short route back through the woods, and
used the rapidly dwindling stock of Droplets of Villi on our soles to
cross Lake Talpha. While crossing the wasteland of the second area
north, we found another fruiting cactus and took a short break to
pick it clean. Myia took off her mask for the first time in hours to eat
and exclaimed that she had never tasted such delicious fruit before.
Kizmel proudly explained to her that a cactus fruited for only thirty
minutes throughout an entire year.
The giant scorpions of the canyon area were as tough as always, but
we made quick work of them with the addition of not one, but two
high-powered NPCs. The gamer in me wanted to just hang out and
farm for half a day, but my conscience got the better of me, and I
knew it wasn’t right to use a ten-year-old girl as a power-leveling
tool. Still, with what we earned in the south-area dungeon yesterday
171|P

and the reward bonus for the “Agate Key” quest, I got to level 21,
and Asuna reached level 20. Kizmel and Myia gave us both a round of
applause when it happened.
A few minutes after one o’clock, we reached the canyon just before
Castle Galey.
“Ooooh…!” Myia marveled at the massive castle in the distance. She
hadn’t been out of Stachion in ten years, so the wonder of seeing the
stately dark elf building had to be far beyond when I first saw
Kawagoe Castle in the real world. For that matter, Kawagoe Castle
didn’t even have any towers, so its profile was much less impressive.
A little while ago, I would have agonized over the question of “What
does a sense of wonder really mean to an NPC?” but my view of
NPCs (of AIs in general) had been updated many times in recent
days. I couldn’t just assume that only Kizmel and Viscount Yofilis
were special NPCs above the rest.
As we approached the castle over the stone bridge that was
apparently once an aqueduct, the bells began ringing, and the heavy
gates started to open. Only then did it occur to me that Myia was a
human and had not accepted any dark elf quests, but the guards did
not seem interested in accosting her, perhaps because of Kizmel’s
presence. I made a mental note to ask about getting the girl another
one of the sigil rings as we trotted through the half-open gates.
Myia exclaimed again as she looked up at the vast branches of the
spirit tree and the looming castle behind it. Castle Galey ran in an arc
along the curved cliff, which had to be a delightful change from
Stachion and all its relentless straight angles. Once this was all done,
we could take her to see Karluin on the fifth floor, Yofel Castle on the
fourth, and Zumfut on the third. Meanwhile, Kizmel lowered the
hood of the Greenleaf Cape and said, “Shall we speak in your room,
Asuna? Or in the dining hall?”

172|P

The fencer lowered her own hood and said, “The bath.”
I knew I didn’t have the right to refuse her, and my only hope in
getting out of it was little Myia, who happily accepted, so I had no
choice but to follow the three women. We used the west-wing stairs
to go underground and arrived at the changing rooms for men and
women. Sulking, I decided that I wouldn’t wear a pair of swim trunks
for defense, just to spite them, and headed into the hot spring for
the indented part below the spirit tree’s hanging roots.
Once I sank into the cloudy hot water up to my shoulders, I
accidentally let out a wheeze of exhilaration. I hated to admit it, but
after marching to Stachion and back, and all the fighting in that dusty
canyon valley, a good soak in a hot bath was like nothing else. I
leaned back against the spring roots and closed my eyes, letting my
mind relax and expand. In the real world, falling asleep in a hot bath
put you at risk of dehydration or drowning. But in the virtual
world…well, if you fell asleep and went under the water here, you’d
probably wind up in a drowning status and lose some HP. And yet, it
was impossible to resist the pleasure of all my muscles relaxing amid
the pleasant, musky plant smell…
“I wonder if he’s still back in there,” said a voice not too far away,
but I was nearly 70 percent of the way to being asleep and didn’t
react in the moment.
“He must have various things to prepare,” said a different voice.
Then the first voice said, “I can’t imagine what he would possibly
need to get ready…But anyway, let’s wait for him near the roots.
Yesterday, I found a dent in them that was almost shaped like an
easy chair…”
Suddenly, something soft rested itself on top of me. No amount of
serenity could prevent me from reacting to this, however. “Hwhoa—
?!”

173|P

It took over two minutes to defuse the crisis that ensued after that.
“I could have sworn that we had a deal to stay on opposite sides of
the center line,” said a voice so cross that I could practically visualize
the puff of steam coming off it.
Without hope of winning, I argued, “But I thought that seat position
was just about at the border line…”
“No! You were nearly four centimeters on the women’s side of the
bath!” Asuna claimed. She was sitting right in the little cocoon space
she stole from me, with Myia resting on her lap. Kizmel sat on a thick
root nearby, but the steam from the bath here was so thick that I
couldn’t even see their silhouettes. The only reason I knew where
the ladies were was from the green and yellow cursors.

174|P

175|P

“And for one thing, if you’re already in the water, you should at least
let us know. When you’re hiding in this spot the way you were, of
course I’m going to assume you have something devious in mind,”
Asuna continued, still grumpy.
Myia innocently chimed in, “I thought you and Kirito were either
brother and sister or boyfriend and girlfriend.”
“W…well, you’re wrong! He’s just a party mem…er, a partner, or a
sidekick, or an attendant, or what have you!” Asuna protested with
fantastic awkwardness.
Idly, I wondered if Myia thought I was the older brother or Asuna
was the older sister. Given the price of the NerveGear and the
difficulty of buying a copy of SAO at launch, it seemed unlikely that
Asuna was any less than fourteen years old, and her wide knowledge
and general bossiness gave her an older-sister air. But every now and
then, she showed a glimpse of childishness that made it much harder
to tell. In any case, attendant was a cruel word to use. Maybe
sidekick really was a better fit…
My thoughts were really going free-form when I was brought back to
attention by Kizmel’s vivid, delighted voice rippling the surface of the
water. “Ha-ha-ha…I have been around you for quite a while, and
even I have trouble ascertaining the particular nature of your
connection. You seem to act with one mind in battle, but you fight
three times a day. That was the second, by the way.”
“What? No, we’ve only fought the one time.”
“You were angry at Kirito for coming back to the room after taking a
walk this morning, weren’t you?”
“Oh, that wasn’t a fight. I was just giving him a warning.”
If you’re going to break it down that way, I can’t even remember
being angry or upset at Asuna, so none of these count as a fight. Of

176|P

course, part of that is because I’m the one who’s always making a mess
of things.
At any rate, if I kept listening to them talk, my nerves were going to
sweat me into a dry sponge, so I cleared my throat and called out
from the other side of the roots. “So, uh, shall we talk about what to
do?”
There was a little splash, and I was keenly aware of three people
concentrating on my presence.
“I suppose so. But I do feel like there aren’t many hard facts that we
can go off of…” Asuna said, so I decided to go ahead and list off what
we knew, which I’d been arranging and mulling over in my head on
the trip to the castle.
“Let’s look at it in chronological order. First off, ten years ago, before
the incident started: Stachion’s lord was Pithagrus, the genius and
so-called puzzle king, while his primary apprentice Cylon and serving
woman Theano lived at his mansion. At that time, Cylon and Theano
were lovers…”
“I wonder if Pithagrus was aware of that,” Asuna murmured.
“No…” Myia piped up, “Mother didn’t speak often of her time living
at the lord’s mansion, but she did say that no one else there knew
about her and my father.”
“Ah, I see…”
“And just before the incident, I’m guessing, Theano became pregnant
with Myia,” I said, trying to be as mature as possible for a middleschool boy talking about the concept of pregnancy. But that
statement made me wonder, on a whim, how the game system
handled the concept of babies and birth. Then I changed my mind,
realizing that NPCs wouldn’t go off and create children of their own
accord. After all, this murder case from ten years ago wasn’t some
actual event that happened in Aincrad; it was just a series of
177|P

memories given to these NPCs to build the story for the player…I
thought. I was pretty sure.
I cleared my throat and continued, “So…one day ten years ago,
Pithagrus tells Cylon that he is choosing another apprentice to be his
successor, and in a rage, Cylon beats Pithagrus to death with the
golden cube that is the symbol of the town lord. Theano, who
witnessed it, couldn’t bring herself to publicly accuse Cylon, her lover
and the father of her unborn child, of murder. While Cylon was out
of the room, she snuck in and removed the golden cube and golden
key. She locked the cube in the dungeon beneath the mansion, and
she hid the key in Pithagrus’s secret second home in a nearby town.
Then she left her job at the mansion.”
I’d explained this all to Asuna on multiple occasions, but I had beta
knowledge that might have been filling in gaps where details had
changed in the final release. Myia did not correct me at any point,
however, which told me that I had the broad details correct.
“After Pithagrus was killed, one cursed puzzle appeared in the town
of Stachion each day. Theano went back to her original home,
focused on raising Myia, and waited for Cylon to come to her and
admit his crime. But Cylon invented a fictional traveler who had been
killed, took the position of lord, and asked any adventurer who came
to the mansion to seek the golden cube. After ten years, Asuna and I
came along and went to the separate home in Suribus on Cylon’s
request, where we found the golden key.”
That made it sound like we were just that much better than anyone
else who tried, but it was inevitable, because that was just how the
story of the quest was set up. The problem was the next part.
“…Then Cylon appeared, paralyzed us with poison gas, stole the key,
and had Terro help take us back to Stachion. But on the road there,
thieves attacked and killed Cylon. Terro fled to Stachion alone,
visited Theano’s house, and explained what had happened. The next
178|P

morning, Theano left Myia a note and the iron key she always kept
on her, went into the dungeon below the mansion via a secret back
door, took the golden cube, and vanished. That same night, a burglar
got into Myia’s house, trying to steal the iron key, but failed…I think I
have all that correct,” I finished.
From across the steamy water, I heard Asuna groan. “Hrrrmmm…
Putting it all together raises more questions than it answers, I feel.
Mostly about Theano…I just don’t understand why she would leave
the iron key at her house. Cylon and Theano lived apart for ten years,
but they kept the keys that were their remembrance of the
relationship for all of those years. I would assume it was something
very precious to Theano…”
“Ha-ha. You have the most romantic opinions, Asuna.” Kizmel
chuckled, drawing a hurried defense from Asuna.
“I—I don’t mean it that way. I’m just being realistic and rational
about it…”
Personally, I was more concerned about the way Kizmel had actually
used the English word romantic—probably an example of Asuna’s
vocabulary infecting her own—but it was a reasonable question.
Given that the keys attracted each other and could lead Cylon’s killer
right to the other, it was much too dangerous to leave it behind with
Myia. And now they had come for the key twice. Myia might have
received Theano’s excellent sword training, but that didn’t seem like
a good reason to expose your own young daughter to danger.
“Speaking of which,” I prompted across the wall of roots, “where is
your mother’s key now, Myia?”
“It’s right around my neck,” she said.
“Oh, that’s good.”

179|P

I exhaled. It was impossible for the fallen elves to sneak into this
castle, but it was also a bit scary to think about it being left
unattended in the changing room.
“And where is your key, Kirito?” she asked.
I was going to say it was “in my inventory” but realized I couldn’t do
that. “It’s, uh, in my book of Mystic Scribing.”
That was the elvish term for it, but fortunately, Myia seemed to
understand. “Oh, you mean that ancient charm that only
adventurers can use.”
Ooooh, I see, I thought. Then another thought occurred to me, and I
asked the girl, “Say, is it all right with you that I’m holding that key?
That was Cylon, your father’s key, so shouldn’t you have both…?”
“No,” she said without an instant of hesitation. “If it’s not too much
trouble, I want you to have it. I think there is a reason there were
two keys and that each of my parents kept one. I feel it is best to
keep them from being too close, until we discover the proper use for
them.”
“Oh…okay.”
For a ten-year-old, she had a very good head on her shoulders. But
was it appropriate to think about an NPC on those terms?
Just then, there was the sound of squirting water—quite literal, I was
certain—and Asuna said, “So if we don’t know where to use the two
keys, and we don’t know why Theano took the golden cube out of
the mansion, then we’re kind of stuck. I have no idea where we
should go and what we should do next.”
“About that,” said Kizmel, who finally broke her silence. Her voice
echoed softly off the rocks. “Why don’t we show the keys to the
storyteller? It is clear they are under some magical charm. I am not
an expert, but the storyteller might be able to tell us something. And

180|P

if I am not mistaken, Kirito and Asuna, you wanted to ask the elder
how to defend against the evil dragon’s poison, yes?”
Once we were done in the hot spring and met up in the lounge room,
it was two o’clock. The four of us downed glasses of cold water
together, then headed for the library on the third floor of the castle’s
east wing. As I walked behind our guide, Kizmel, and Myia, who had
put her gas mask on again, I found myself filled with both excitement
and worry.
If we got new information on the iron keys, it could propel us
forward on this stalled quest. But I was fairly certain that the
storyteller Kizmel mentioned was none other than Bouhroum, the
eccentric old man I met in the outer mountain ring early this
morning. I didn’t dislike the steak-loving old coot, but I still didn’t
know how to use the Awakening skill—not actually a skill but a
modification for the Meditation skill—that I’d worked so hard to get,
and he didn’t give me a single bite of hamburg steak, either. I had a
hard time imagining him giving us honest answers about the keys.
And on top of that, how should I act around him when we met him in
the library?
“Hey, Kirito,” said Asuna quietly into my ear. I quickly looked in her
direction.
“Wh…what’s up?”
“When do you think Qusack will return?”
“Oh…”
Until she said that, I had completely forgotten about the other group
of players. My eyes wandered for a moment. “Um…they said they
were going for the ‘Agate Key’ quest today, so it might be as late as
this eve…no, wait. They can’t take the shortcut across Lake Talpha,
so they have to go from the northwest area where we are,
counterclockwise, through the west and then south. That’s a long
181|P

journey…I’m guessing they’ll spend the night at Goskai on the
southern end, then be back by tomorrow afternoon.”
“I see. So they won’t happen across Myia until that point.”
At last, I understood what Asuna was worried about. We were able
to explain Kizmel’s presence because she was our bodyguard NPC for
the “Elf War” questline. But it was clearly abnormal for a human NPC
to be hanging out in Castle Galey. I could easily imagine, given his
status as an expert on quests, that Gindo would ask all sorts of
questions to satisfy his curiosity.
“Hmm…Well, I suppose we ought to come up with some kind of story
that seems natural enough…” I muttered.
But Asuna frowned. “I don’t want to lie to people who are really
taking their quests seriously, but if they find out that the ‘Curse of
Stachion’ quest is still ongoing, they’ll definitely be curious about it.”
“And if things get messy, they might end up targeted by the fallen
elves, too. The Unknown Burglars in Stachion were definitely tougher
than the fallen elf soldiers we’ve dealt with in the ‘Elf War’ campaign
quest, and if they use paralysis needles, they’re even deadlier.
Depending on the circumstances, we might want to leave the castle
before they return tomorrow…”
On the other hand, we needed a destination before we left. Without
any idea about Theano’s current whereabouts or goal, our only hope
was old Bouhroum’s knowledge and item appraisal.
A moment later, Kizmel spun around, her long cape twirling. “This is
the library. The storyteller should be within…”
She opened the heavy door there, on the left side of the hallway. A
scent came flooding out of the doorway, like dried plant matter but
not unpleasant at all.

182|P

Beyond the threshold was a very spacious room filled with huge
bookshelves that stretched all the way to the ceiling. I’d been
imagining a library like the kind in school, but the crimson carpets
running along the aisles and the huge oil paintings on the walls were
even more posh than the decorations in Pithagrus’s secret home. I
reached out to one of the polished and heavily decorated
bookshelves in order to remove one of the leather-bound books, but
as usual, the contents belonged to a text from some European
country and were completely illegible to me.
I put the book back and hurried after Kizmel. We did a one-eighty
around one aisle and found a small room-sized open space ahead
with a table, sofa, and large resting chair. The space seemed empty
at first, but as we approached, I noticed that the easy chair, which
was pointed toward the far wall, was making an odd noise.
Kizmel and Myia came to a stop, so I went past them to get a view of
what was in the chair. Peacefully asleep was an old man with a black
robe, black hat, long white beard, and little round glasses on his
nose: none other than Bouhroum, the self-styled sage.
“Well…it would seem the storyteller is resting now. So what should
we do…?” Kizmel wondered, looking troubled. I gave her a glance,
then grabbed the backrest of the easy chair and began to hurtle it
back and forth.
“Whaaaa—?! What is it?! What’s happening?!” shouted the old man
instantly, leaping upward. He then saw me, his glasses askew, and
shouted again. “Y-you! The potato boy! Why are you here?! I already
told you—you can’t have any of my fricatelle!”
An NPC, sleeping on the job. Disappointed, I told him, “I’m not
‘potato boy’—my name is Kirito. And I’m not here to eat any
fricatelle.”

183|P

“Hrmm…?” The old man hummed, fixing his glasses. He looked
around and finally noticed Kizmel, Asuna, and Myia standing behind
me. He leaped immediately to his nimble feet, rubbing his long beard
into place and clearing his throat.
“Ahem! Ahhh-hem! Beautiful knight of Lyusula and human
swordswoman, how may this old man help you?”
Wow, that’s not the welcome I received, I couldn’t help but notice.
Since the women were too stunned to respond, I decided to pick up
the mantle instead.
“We came because we need your help with something, Grandpa
Bouhroum. I was hoping you could tell us a few things.”
I explained our early-morning meeting in as abbreviated a form as
possible, glossing over the secret chamber and hamburg steak, then
went into my game inventory to pull out one of the iron keys. I
dangled it before the old man’s eyes and asked, “Gramps, do you
know what this key goes to?”
“Hmm…?” Bouhroum took the key, scrutinized it closely, then tilted
his pointed hat to the right. “Well, now…it appears to have an odd
charm placed upon it, but I do not recognize it.”
“L-look closer. You’re our only hope now, Gramps…I mean, Master
Sage.”
“Ah, so you only suck up to me with the ‘Master Sage’ routine when
you need something,” the old man muttered, resting in the easy
chair again. He glanced at the women, who still looked stunned, and
gestured to the sofa with a wrinkled hand. “Ah, forgive me for
keeping you standing. Please, young ladies, have a seat. There is tea
and some cups on that table, boy, so go and do the thing.”
I decided to swallow my complaint and went to the table. If I had to
grind it from whole leaves, it would be beyond my means, but
fortunately, the large glass pot was already full of reddish-brown
184|P

liquid. I set the four cups on the silver tray and carefully poured out
the tea, then took it over to the low table.
I put one cup each before the women on the three-cushion couch
and started lifting the fourth one to my lips when a hand stretched
from the easy chair and snatched it away. The old man sipped the
tea noisily and looked up from the dangling key to my face.
“You have another one just like this, don’t you?” he gruffed.
“Uh, yeah…How did you know?”
I almost wanted to remark that I thought he was just some steakloving old coot. Over on the couch, Myia silently pulled the other key
from her shirt and held it out, only silence emanating from her gas
mask. The old man took it and let it hang so he could inspect it.
“Hrmm, hrmm…”
Bouhroum returned his teacup to the table and moved the key closer
to mine. A high-pitched ringing echoed off the high library ceiling,
and each time the keys were directly facing each other, they shook
as if alive. The old man pushed the keys even closer together.
You know, I don’t think we ever actually stuck the keys together.
Which is funny, because usually these things don’t take their true form
until you combine them…
No sooner had the thought occurred to me than there came a silver
flash and a bzak!! sound. The keys hurtled out of our hands and
struck a wall and bookshelf.
Neither I nor any of the women could react in the moment. The only
sound came from Bouhroum himself.
“Fwaaah?!”
“Hey, you were the one who did it!” I shouted, going to look for the
key that flew out of my hand. I saw it hit the wall and bounce off, but
after that…It was probably around the tea table in the corner…
185|P

“Ah…found it.” The string had snagged around the tall teapot. The
other key flew toward the bookshelf, and Asuna got up to retrieve it
from between shelves. She gave it back to Myia, and then, having
apparently adjusted to Bouhroum’s personality, finally addressed
him in her usual way.
“Mr. Bouhroum…what just happened? It looked like the keys
repulsed each other…”
“Ah yes…That is because they did. There is a powerful charm placed
upon the keys that prevents them from making contact.”
“Placed upon…?” I asked. “In other words, it didn’t already exist until
someone cast the charm on the keys?”
“Well, obviously,” he said, about three times ruder to me than he
had been to Asuna.
Undeterred, I pressed, “Who would do such a thing? And why?”
“How would you expect me to know that?” he snorted, infuriated.
Next, it was Kizmel’s turn: “But, Storyteller, you are said to be one of
greatest minds in all of Lyusula. Do you not have any deductions, any
hunches? We will take any clue we can get at this point.”
“I can certainly do that much,” Bouhroum admitted. He glared at the
key in my hand. “From what I can see, those two keys were originally
meant to be combined before use. The head and teeth of the keys
are carved to align perfectly.”
“Huh? Really…?”
I looked back and forth from my key to Myia’s, but I couldn’t tell
from their appearance. And I couldn’t test it, because they would
hurtle away from each other. But I also couldn’t imagine that the
self-styled sage would just make something up off the top of his
head, so I assumed that my hunch that they combined to take their
true form was actually not far off the mark.
186|P

In that case, if we could undo the charm on the keys and combine
them, we might gain some new clue or bit of information.
“Undo the charm, Gramps,” I said promptly. He glared at me.
“It is not that simple. I just told you it was a powerful charm…I
suspect that only the one who placed this charm can undo its effect.”
“Aww…then tell us who put the—”
“Kaaaah!” he snapped, the familiar noise I heard multiple times
during my Awakening training. Without getting out of the chair, he
brandished a fist at me. “Just because I am a great and wise sage
does not mean I know everything! I’ve told you all that I know about
those keys!”
Or that you know anything, I snapped from the safety of my
innermost thoughts. Once again, I considered the keys. Even
Bouhroum’s wisdom did not bring us much new insight, but on the
other hand…without Morte’s interference in killing Cylon, this was
not an item that was officially meant to fall into player hands. So I
couldn’t complain too much about a lack of explanation.
Hopefully, the old man could at least live up to his billing with the
other topic we wanted to hear about—but that remained to be seen.
I grabbed Asuna’s half-finished tea, downed the rest, and broached
the second topic.
“By the way, Gramps…we’d like to ask you about a wicked dragon by
the name of Shmargor…”
Ten minutes later, I left the library alone. Asuna, Kizmel, and Myia
remained behind to train under the old man.
Our mission to ask about a means to counteract the fallen elves’
poisoned needles was a success, if in a different form than what I
expected. Bouhroum did not know how to craft the Platinum Shield
that the ancient hero Selm supposedly used to protect against

187|P

Shmargor’s spikes, but he was able to suggest a substitute means of
knowing. It was, in fact, through using the Meditation skill.
Training for Meditation was not as difficult as breaking the rock for
martial arts. All you had to do was hold the pose that activated the
skill for one continuous hour. In the beta, the sitting place was atop a
pillar no more than fifteen centimeters wide, so it was difficult to get
the hang of it.
But this time, when the ladies suggested learning the skill,
Bouhroum’s method of training was to stay still for an hour atop
some soft, poofy cushions on the floor. I couldn’t help but yell about
that one. But there was no point ranting about how “the beta was
different.” I wanted to observe this alternate training, but Asuna
kicked me out of the room, claiming that it was embarrassing to have
me watching.
Certainly, holding a Zen-like meditative pose wasn’t exactly
glamorous or cute, but if you wanted to use it in battle, you had to
do that pose, regardless of location. I told her she needed to get
used to the idea of people watching, but she shut me down and
booted me out of the library.
At least I knew, given the cushy setting, that all three of them should
pass the test on the first try. It seemed unprecedented that NPCs
could pick up Extra Skills, but the bar for surprising me had risen
considerably over the last few days. Nothing was going to truly shock
me anymore unless you told me that, say, Kizmel and Myia were
actually being controlled by human players.
But enough about that. I shook my head to clear it and headed for
the windows on the southern side of the hallway. It was still before
three o’clock, meaning the sunlight filling Castle Galey’s courtyard
was growing just a faint tint of gold, but there was still time until
sunset. I wanted to put this extra hour to good use, but I didn’t want

188|P

to go grinding outside the castle, in case Asuna noticed my HP bar
going down, and she got distracted by it.
“So my options are…nap or a snack…”
Three seconds later, I settled on snack. My store of sweet treats was
rather lonely, but I could probably find something good if I went to
the dining hall.
I walked west down the hall and went to the second floor of the
center building. The dining hall was quite empty, because it wasn’t
mealtime, but when I sat down in a sofa along the wall, a servant
approached at once. I asked for the dessert lineup, then selected a
chestnut-and-walnut tart and an herbal tea.
The tart was a luxurious one, with sweet boiled chestnuts, fragrant
cooked walnuts, and a heap of smooth sweet cream, and it quickly
vanished into my virtual stomach. I sipped the sour tea and was
considering ordering another tart when a strong desire to sleep hit
me like a ton of bricks.
Suddenly, I recalled that I’d forced myself awake at two in the
morning, went exploring around the rim of the castle, and completed
Bouhroum’s Awakening training in his little hidden room. Then I
marched all the way to Stachion and returned not long after. After
that hard schedule, it was no wonder that sitting on a comfortable
couch and eating a piece of cake made me sleepy. I tried to resist,
but the weight on my eyelids accelerated with each blink.
There would be another thirty…no, forty minutes until their
Meditation training was over. Surely I was allowed to get a bit of a
nap until then. If this was a restaurant in the real world, a stern
waitress would be by to ask if I wanted anything else, but certainly
the dark elf stewards would be nice enough to let me sleep……
Clang…clang…clang.

189|P

The sharp sound of the bell pulled me out of my comfortable
slumber.
I tensed up at first, then realized it was just Qusack returning from
their quest. I imagined it would have been tomorrow, but maybe
they’d just rushed through the steps without any stops or sidequesting along the way.
There I sat, pondering that idea with my eyes closed, half-asleep—
when suddenly the speed and intensity of the ringing jumped in
pitch: Clang-clang-clang-clang-clang!!

190|P

I LEAPED UP FROM THE SOFA AND SPRINTED ACROSS the dining hall
to the door, almost entirely on autopilot.
The chilly air of the hallway helped to banish the last lingering
embrace of sleep. I pounced toward the window across the hall and
stared through the glass down into the courtyard.
The first thing I saw was the wide-open gates of the castle. The
flickering white flashes I saw intermittently coming from there were
definitely the visual effects of a battle.
I pushed open the window, hardly thinking about what I was doing,
and the sound of sharp clanging and shouts rose in volume. The
servants gathered at the doorway behind me shrieked.
Fighting at the inside of the gates were the familiar dark elf castle
guards against a group of black-clad warriors with similar features
but who sported distinctive face-covering masks. I squinted, focusing
on the group, and saw a bright-red cursor appear with the subtitle
FALLEN ELVEN WARRIOR.
Fallen elves!
I had an inkling it was them when I first saw them, but to have it
spelled out officially by the system made the shock bigger. They’d led
small ambushes and sneak attacks in the wilderness and dungeons
before, but no large-scale assaults like this. They’d kept to the
shadows in the background of the struggle between forest and dark
elves. So why would they lead a head-on invasion of Castle Galey,
perhaps the best-defended of the dark elf strongholds? How had
they gotten the guards to open the gates? And I thought the elves
weren’t supposed to be capable of getting through that barren valley
without help…

191|P

The questions came hard and fast, but they weren’t going to answer
themselves if I just stood here and watched. I had to make a decision
about what to do.
For the moment, the invasion seemed to be contained between the
castle gates and the spirit tree’s pool, but more and more fallen elves
were pouring through the open gates by the moment. There had to
be twenty at this point, possibly thirty. More guards were rushing
forth from the palace to defend it, of course, but the Fallen seemed
more powerful individually. I had a feeling that relying upon the
guards to defend the castle might not be a winning strategy.
But my highest priority at this moment was the lives of Asuna,
Kizmel, and Myia.
Working backward from that conclusion, I supposed we should try to
escape the castle while the guards were still holding back the fallen
elves. On the other hand, proud knight Kizmel would never flee and
abandon her comrades, and Asuna would surely want to fight at
Kizmel’s side.
In any case, the first step was to regroup with them in the library. I
pulled away from the window and began to run.
“Ah…!” I heard myself gasp.
The dark elf guards fighting at the courtyard line of defense faltered,
three of them dropping at once. Their cursors showed their HP at still
over half full. I was stunned, until I noticed a certain ominous icon
blinking below the bars. Paralysis.
Some distance away, along the side walls of the castle, a number of
enemy elves labeled FALLEN ELVEN SCOUTS were throwing
something at the guards. I couldn’t see it from here, but I understood
instinctually that it was those poison needles again.
The dark elf guards had metal armor on, but it was not full plate.
Much of their arms and legs was uncovered, making for easy targets.
192|P

The hole in the defensive line reformed with new guards, and the
collapsed members were pulled back to safety, but it was clear that if
too many more got paralyzed, the line would quickly crumble.
To regroup with Asuna or to rush to the aid of the guards? I myself
was paralyzed with indecision for a moment, until at last I sucked in a
sharp breath and broke into action.
I opened my window and plopped down onto the ground of the
hallway. First, I sent a brief (possibly unnecessary) message to Asuna
to FINISH THE TRAINING, then folded my legs into the Zen lotus
position. In real Zen meditation, I was supposed to form an elliptical
sigil with my hands, but in this world, I simply had to stretch out all
my fingers and place my palms atop my upturned feet. This was the
activation pose of the Meditation skill.
In the beta, you had to hold this pose for sixty whole seconds before
the buff would take effect. Since there was no way to make that kind
of time once battle started, it was quickly labeled a worthless skill,
but now I had it leveled up to 500. That probably lowered the preactivation time.
Please let me be right about that! I prayed. The system didn’t
respond, of course, but by the time I silently counted to twenty, an
icon that I hadn’t seen in several months appeared on my HP gauge.
It was the silhouette of a person in a Zen pose: the Meditation buff.
If I was to take Bouhroum at his word, this buff could nullify level-2
paralyzing poison. If it didn’t, that would be very bad news for me,
but if I stood here and watched, the same thing would happen
anyway. All I could do was trust the old man and act.
I undid the lotus position, stood up, and commanded the servants
behind me, “Go to the storeroom and bring all the healing and
antidote potions you can to the courtyard!”

193|P

Most of the servants shrank back toward the dining hall, looking
terrified, but the oldest-looking of them all said bravely, “I
understand. Come, you lot, let’s go!” and lifted up her long skirt to
run for the east wing. Her younger coworkers, properly chastised,
shared a brief look before rushing after her.
I started running without a backward glance. I would have loved to
jump down into the courtyard from the window, but the Fallen
scouts would spot me. I wanted to get at least one by surprise.
I sprinted for the end of the west wing, sending a second message to
Asuna in the meantime. MAKE SIRE ALL THREE OF YUO HAVE MED
BUFF BEFORE GOING DOWN TO CORTYARD, I sent, too quickly to
bother correcting my typos. Based on the present time, it had been
about fifty-five minutes since they began Meditation training.
If the training was over the moment the bell started clamoring, then
none of these instructions mattered, but the fact that there had
been no response was a sign that the training still continued—I
assumed. I had a feeling that the matter of whether Asuna’s group
gained the Meditation skill or not, and whether they could utilize it in
time for the fight or not, would be the key to victory or defeat.
On I rushed from the main building to the west wing, leaping down
the stairs ten at a time, when all of a sudden I heard a memory of my
partner’s voice in my head:
You’re not going to rush off without a word to me again! You must
be within my sight for all twenty-four hours. Is that understood?!
That had been three days ago…after we talked with the DKB officers
in the inn room in Stachion. I’d kept to her command since then,
excepting only unavoidable situations like the hot spring’s changing
room, but I’d assumed Castle Galey was safe and apparently let
down my guard. Asuna told me not to watch them training, but there
were all those bookcases in the library. I could have just waited
around the corner of one.
194|P

And right during that lax hour, as if specifically timed, the fallen elves
attacked. It was a coincidence, of course, but it felt like a sign. I
picked up speed, trying to outrun my foreboding, and blazed through
to the side door at the end of the west wing’s first floor.
I had to put on the brakes, as satisfying as it would have been to kick
down the door and rush through it. Instead, I opened it just a bit to
check for the presence of nearby enemies. Because the side door
was quite close to the interior wall, if I went out and headed along
the wall, I should reach the scouts throwing the poisoned needles
soon. But it was only half-past three in the afternoon, and there was
little darkness that would hide my presence.
I couldn’t wait until nightfall for cover, obviously. I just had to draw
my blade and head out into the open.
A wall of sound met me there, swords clashing and bellows of
combat and rage. I hunched against the noise and ran along the wall
to my right.
The round hollow that entirely swallowed Castle Galey was a bit over
two hundred meters across, and the spring that fed the spirit tree in
the middle of its grounds was about thirty meters wide, so that made
about eighty meters from the castle wall to the hot spring. The
defensive line of the castle guards had already been pushed back
over half of the way. If they managed to break into the castle, it
would be very difficult to prevent the Fallen from reaching the
treasure room on the fourth floor of the main castle building, where
the four sacred keys were currently held.
We had to stop them in the courtyard. And eliminating the Fallen
Scouts throwing their paralyzing needles was paramount.
As soon as I saw the first scout ahead of me, I went from staying low
and quiet to a full-on spring. The scout sensed me and turned,

195|P

wearing a mask with only holes for the eyes. He pulled a black pick
from his belt and wound his arm back.
When I saw the glint of the throwing needle, a memory of three
nights ago flashed back in my head. The feeling of being helpless on
the ground, unable to move a finger, staring up at the horrifying sight
of Morte approaching, became a liquid colder than ice that shot
through my veins.
But I gritted my teeth, withstanding the fear, and readied my Sword
of Eventide on high.
The Fallen Scout’s hand blurred. A Spine of Shmargor coated with
level-2 paralyzing poison rushed for my chest, whistling faintly. It was
too late to dodge or defend.
If my Meditation buff didn’t protect against this paralysis, I was going
to land helpless on the ground in the midst of a chaotic battle.
There was a light impact below my left collarbone. A dark blot
appeared out of the lower corner of my eye. But I cut off my sense of
touch and sight, focusing my entire mind on the sword in my hand.
The blade shone blue. The invisible hand of system assistance
pushed my body.
No paralysis!
“Go!” I shouted, the word trapped behind closed lips, and I activated
the four-part slash skill, Vertical Square.
The scout’s eyes widened just a bit when he realized I wasn’t
paralyzed. He reached behind his waist for a dagger, but it was too
late. My first blow struck the scout’s left shoulder, leaving a shining
vertical line in the air.
In a single moment, my sword bounced back upward, completing
slashes straight down and straight up, leaving parallel visual effects

196|P

from head to toe. These three slashes took down nearly 60 percent
of the scout’s HP.
Then my sword returned to its original position and arched farther,
nearly to my back, before unleashing the devastating fourth strike.
Once again, I felt the hilt of the Sword of Eventide trembling in the
palm of my hand. But rather than fighting against the sword’s will, I
added a boost of force to its adjusted course.
Zumm! The elf-upgraded blade dug itself heavily into the Fallen
Scout’s breast. The weak-point critical blow obliterated his remaining
40 percent. The completed square of blue light flashed brighter and
dispersed, and a moment later, the scout’s body shattered into
countless pieces, too.
I’d killed over ten fallen elves since the start of the “Elf War”
campaign quest. It was a simple matter, of course, as I had to do it to
finish the quests—or so I had always assumed, but that probably still
counted as a kind of murder.
Regardless, I couldn’t stop now. I was helping the dark elves, and I
had to protect Asuna, Kizmel, and Myia from harm. Asuna treated
the NPCs as even more human than I did, and she wouldn’t hesitate
at all to fight against the Fallen.
Through the polygons melting into the air, I saw the other two Fallen
Elven Scouts throwing their needles at the guards from the other
side of the castle gates. I couldn’t imagine that they hadn’t noticed
my attack, but for now, they prioritized helping their comrades
fighting farther in.
For just an instant, I glanced left and saw that there were now
slightly more red cursors for Fallen Elven Warriors than yellow
cursors for the castle guards.
“…?!”

197|P

Before my gaze could return to the two scouts, I noticed something
and squinted.
The fallen elf combatants, dressed all in black and fighting with their
backs to me, had something odd tucked into their sword belts. They
were narrow rods with brilliant-green shards of something tied to
the top…No, those were not artificially fashioned objects. They were
tree branches.
The branches were about a third of a meter in length with leaves on
the end, as though broken off of any nearby tree. I wouldn’t think
twice of any player carrying the same thing around.
But the fact that these were fallen elves changed the situation. They,
like all elves, could not harm living trees. I remembered General
N’ltzahh saying as much in the submerged dungeon on the fourth
floor, where the fallen elves were secretly buying lumber from
humans. Eons since we were removed from the blessing of the Holy
Tree, yet, we are still bound by the taboos of the elven race.
The secret of how the Fallen had moved through the canyons was
probably—no, definitely—contained in those branches. However
they had circumvented the taboo, they seemed to be protected by a
kind of personal barrier cast forth by the branches. Which meant
their next likely move was…
“Gaaah!”
A scream from the courtyard distracted me. A dark elf guard at the
front line of combat collapsed on the ground, struck down by a
Fallen Elven Warrior’s curved blade. Before his companions could
reach out to him, his body turned to blue shards and vanished.
“Damn…!” I swore, banishing the mystery of the branches from my
head. Our first priority was to turn back the tide of battle. My
Meditation buff would eventually wear off. I had to eliminate the
other two scouts before it did.
198|P

I switched my sword to my left hand and pulled out the paralyzing
needle stuck under my collarbone. It was still usable, so I wound up
and threw it at one of the scouts located near the right-gate tower.
Until I used Meditation in my fifth skill slot, I’d been considering
putting Throwing Knives in there. Thankfully, even without it active,
the needle still managed to land in the left leg of the scout, who was
a nice stationary target. He didn’t seem to have any paralysis defense
himself, and he collapsed without a sound after a green border
appeared around his cursor. The other one rushed to give his partner
a potion, but I was already charging at full speed again.
The last scout gave up on curing his partner and readied a dagger. I
gave him a simple high slice. He evaded with a backstep rather than
guarding it, but I was expecting that. When I froze briefly following
my big swing, the scout deftly darted forward and whipped his
dagger at me.
This fierce blow was a fair bit sharper than any I’d seen from the
Fallen thus far, but I was already lunging into his range so I could pull
off Flash Blow, the basic Martial Art skill I used against Morte.
The dagger grazed my right shoulder while my left fist slammed into
his side. The NPC and monster algorithms, whether intended or not,
had a habit of responding just a bit slower to sudden use of a
different type of attack skill.
“Oogh…”
Flash Blow’s damage wasn’t much to speak of, but the scout grunted
and froze. This would be my chance to use a sword skill…but instead,
I reached around the scout’s back with my free hand. As I expected,
my fingers brushed what felt like a tree branch. I grabbed it and
pulled it out of his belt.
I didn’t expect this to cause the fallen elf to immediately collapse.
After all, we were in the courtyard beneath the spirit tree’s
199|P

protection. They wouldn’t need the branch unless they went back
out the gate.
But the scout’s eyes bulged behind the mask, and he shouted
hoarsely, “Give it back!”
Before he could scramble and lunge for it, I held the tip of the Sword
of Eventide to the elf’s throat and demanded, “How did you get this
branch?!”
“…That is nothing you need to know, human!” the elf spat, lowering
his weapon in favor of dialogue. There were fires of hatred in his
eyes. “And what business does your kind have in this fight?! The
enmity between elves has nothing to do with humankind!!”
“‘Your kind…?’” I repeated, sensing something off about this. I
glanced around—but the only figure nearby was the third scout,
paralyzed. Asuna and Myia had not joined the battle.
The scout clicked his tongue, angry that he had apparently spoken
too much. He leaped backward to get away from the tip of my sword
and readied his dagger again. Sensing that I wouldn’t get any more
information out of him, I held the branch high in my free hand. The
moment his gaze traveled upward to follow it, I tossed it to the side
and lunged.
The scout looked back, but it was enough to delay his reaction. I took
advantage by using the close-range three-hit skill Sharp Nail. Three
slashes of red light, like the claws of a fierce beast, glowed on the
scout’s chest, and he flew backward, slamming against the castle
wall. When he bounced back to me, I added the single-strike
Horizontal.
His torso cut in two, the scout silently came to an unnatural stop in
midair and dispersed. I turned around as the shards enveloped me
and ran.

200|P

The paralyzed scout had another branch behind his back, too. The
paralysis status wasn’t wearing off anytime soon, but the eye that
was visible from this angle speared me with a look sharper than any
throwing needle.
He would eventually recover, so I couldn’t just leave this Scout
untouched. If I simply pierced him through the heart while he was
immobile, the continual piercing damage would be enough to kill
him.
Instead, I stopped myself from raising my sword any farther. Perhaps
it was a pointless fixation, perhaps even a harmful emotion, but I just
couldn’t bring myself to execute a helpless enemy like it was some
kind of insect.
The scout had pockets for throwing needles on either side of his
leather belt, and there were nearly ten Spines of Shmargor still inside
them. I removed them all, stuck them in my own carrying pouch,
took away his branch and black dagger, and tossed them into my
inventory. I also found the other branch I’d tossed—and turned to
inspect the battle.
The paralyzing needle sabotage was over, but the defensive line was
pushed back to barely fifteen meters from the hot spring. If the
guards fell into the water, the line would collapse, and the enemy
could rush through. Once that happened, they could be at the castle
entrance in moments.
There were about twenty-five Fallen Elven Warriors in combat and
not even twenty castle guards fighting them back. About ten were
paralyzed and dragged to the rear, and there were no more guards
rushing out of the castle.
This was the full combat force of Castle Galey, because, sadly, I didn’t
expect that Count Galeyon himself would come rushing down to turn
the tide of battle.

201|P

A few seconds later, I had the lay of the battle and pulled the
paralyzing needles out of my pouch, intent on making good use of
them. There were nine needles, plus the two I recovered from Morte
and the two that the Fallen who attacked Myia’s home left behind,
for thirteen in total. If I could knock out ten warriors with those, we
could turn this battle around. I aimed for the back of the closest
target and threw.
The needle landed right on target, in the gap between armor pieces.
The warrior froze for a moment…then continued swinging his
scimitar as though nothing had just happened.
“Wha…?”
I held my breath, then noticed an unfamiliar icon on the warrior’s HP
bar. It looked like a black leaf; perhaps it was a paralysis resistance
buff. I supposed that with all the needles the scouts were throwing
from behind, a few might hit their own side. So it would make sense
for them to have some kind of safety measure against that…but it
also felt like a very clever strategy, almost too clever for NPCs.
And for another thing, I still didn’t know how the fallen elves had
gotten through the gates.
I was sleeping in the dining hall when the bell woke me up. But I
recalled first hearing the normal tolling for the opening of the gates;
only after a few moments did it turn into a rapid alarm bell. Did that
mean the guards had opened the gates for someone who was
allowed in, and then the Fallen rushed through? But there was no
place to hide in the long, dusty canyon leading up to the gates. If
dozens of enemies were running from the start of the canyon, there
would still be time to let the guest in and close the gates before they
arrived.
There was only one possibility.

202|P

Whoever got the gates to open was in cahoots with the Fallen…and
at this moment, there was only one group of players this far along in
the “Elf War” campaign quest: Qusack. If they went into the castle
and took over the tower-gate room, they could ensure the gate
remained open long enough for the fallen elves to arrive.
“…Is that really it…?” I asked myself, unable to believe it. I turned and
raced to the nearby gate tower and opened the metal-reinforced
door. I thrust my sword into the open space, but there was no one
inside. If the dark elf who would have been here was murdered,
there was no way for me to search for evidence.
I looked up to see that the tower chamber was packed with gears
and weights and such over my head. On the wall straight ahead was
a wooden lever that I yanked with all my strength.
With a heavy rumble, the gears overhead began to turn. That should
at least close the gate and ensure that any potential Fallen
reinforcements outside couldn’t get in. I was worried about where
Qusack might have gone, but the battle in the courtyard was the
most pressing matter at the moment.
I leaped out of the tower and raced for the line of battle. If the
paralyzing needles weren’t going to work on those Fallen Elven
Warriors, my trusty sword would have to do.
“Raaaaah!!”
I roared, power surging from deep in my gut, giving up my backattack advantage. Three nearby enemies turned around and closed
the gap. I hurtled into the middle of them, getting as close as I
possibly could before activating the sword skill Horizontal Square. It
didn’t do as much damage to a single target as Vertical Square did,
but it had a better accuracy and wider range.
The sequence of four horizontal slashes hit all three warriors, taking
two-thirds of their health and hurling them backward. If I could use
203|P

this newly learned skill over and over, I could probably take them all
down, but it sadly had a cooldown timer to match its considerable
strength, and I wouldn’t be able to use it again for a bit. I would have
to make full use of all the sword skills I’d learned so far. There were
over twenty foes here, and if I got surrounded, I was instantly dead
meat.
Two more enemies noticed my presence behind them. I used the
long-range jumping attack Sonic Leap on one of them. That warrior
guarded the attack, but his scimitar was weaker than the Sword of
Eventide, and he faltered, unable to withstand the full brunt of my
charge.
The instant that hateful post-skill delay let up, I used the martial arts
kick Water Moon on the faltering warrior. My instinct measured the
distance of the other enemy behind me—I spun and activated the
two-part Horizontal Arc. The slashes left a sideways V in the warrior’s
chest. He flew through the air with a grunt.
It was too bad that I couldn’t deliver him a finishing blow, but if I
spent too much time on one foe, I would get surrounded. The three
knocked down by my Horizontal Square were getting up now, I
noticed, and so I used the low-to-the-ground charging attack Rage
Spike on one of them.
My sliding dash was so close to the ground that it practically army
crawled. The warrior tried to use the basic scimitar skill Reaver to
fight back. If it hit me, not only would my skill fail, but I’d be put in a
mild-stun status. So I twisted as I ran, trying to escape the path of the
Reaver. On the other hand, if I strayed too far from the right motion,
I would automatically fumble my sword skill. The pale-blue shine
coating my sword flickered, letting me know that the technique was
in danger of running out.
“Jyaaa!” the warrior roared, swinging down his blade that glowed a
sinister orange. The sharp tip grazed my chest, taking away about 5
204|P

percent of my HP with it—but in return, my sword severed his left
leg from the base. The warrior’s remaining HP were gone, and his
slender form crumbled like fine glass.
The beautiful, horrendous sound effect seemed to draw the
attention of all the other Fallen fighting in the vast courtyard. One
especially large one in the center of the fighting, who seemed to be
the commanding officer, pointed his scimitar—more like a long
saber—and shouted, “Get rid of that impediment first! Surround him
on four sides and crush him!”
Instantly, four virtually unharmed warriors peeled off the line and
came rushing for me. That opened a hole in their line, of course, but
the Fallen still had the higher number.
One of the guards shouted “Protect the swordsman!” but it would be
difficult for them to break through the Fallen line even with the hole.
I had to deal with these four by myself—in fact, if I could just get
through this oncoming rush, it would turn the numbers in our favor
and make victory a possibility.
The fallen elves slid smoothly around me on either side. I still
couldn’t use Horizontal Square, my one good wide-range attack, so I
backed off, looking for the right target to strike, but they were all
dressed in matching black gear and hoods, with about the same
remaining HP, so it was impossible to choose an obvious answer.
Behind the four, the warriors whose HP I’d halved were now
retreating to the wall and drinking what appeared to be healing
potions. If they got back to full health, and the four surrounding me
turned to eight, it would be difficult to even escape, much less wipe
them out.
The worst mistake to make in this situation was to be too hasty in
knocking down the enemy numbers and to stop moving. As with
monsters, the common wisdom was to keep moving, avoid being

205|P

surrounded, and grind down the enemy HP, bit by bit. If this
happened in a dungeon, other players might get mad, because you
could easily build a “mob train” by drawing the attention of more
and more monsters, but manners didn’t mean anything here.
“…!!”
I sucked in a sharp breath and pounced off the stone ground,
sprinting after the target I chose on pure instinct. The enemy raised
his scimitar diagonally in a defensive position, while the other three
rushed to get behind me. Their reaction speed and teamwork were
much better than monsters’, though one should expect that much.
The only plus, for whatever it was worth, was that none of the Fallen
Elven Warriors had heavy gear or shields. Such fighters were very
difficult to break down, but these ones only had metal light armor
and their curved swords, which meant I could get past their
defenses.
I charged straight ahead, sword hanging from my right hand. The
warrior’s eyes seemed to waver, losing their nerve. Perhaps he
intended to defend my first blow, but charging without an attacking
stance was introducing an element of uncertainty to the AI’s
algorithm.
When I was two meters away, the warrior finally entered an
attacking stance. I accelerated as best I could and thrust out my open
hand with my fingers formed in the shape of a capital C. I made sure
to let the enemy’s scimitar slip through that narrow gap and
dispelled the primal fear of losing my fingers as I clenched down
hard.
There was a silver flash in my hand, and I felt my grip and the
warrior’s sword become fused into one. I yanked the weapon out of
the enemy’s hand and flipped it around to grasp the hilt. This was
the weapon-snatching skill, Empty Wheel, which I acquired when my

206|P

martial arts skill reached a proficiency of 100, right in the middle of
this very battle. Naturally, it was my first time using it, and if I hadn’t
ponied up the dough for Argo’s info on martial arts, I might not have
realized I had it available until the battle was over.
“How dare you, knave?!” snarled the warrior, who lunged for his
weapon. I swiped at his arm with the Sword of Eventide and scored a
severed part bonus. The warrior moaned, clutching his partially
missing arm. I kicked him over and spun around.
The other three warriors showed no sign of slowing down after
seeing my weapon-snatching trick.
“Shyaaa!”
I blocked a black-traced diagonal slash with the scimitar in my offhand. The sparks of that impact splashed off my face as I slammed
my sword into his side.
Sensing another attack to my right, I used the sword to block a
horizontal strike. The warrior faltered, and I slashed at his neck with
the scimitar I’d captured, then rushed through the gap between the
two.
As long as I had the Sword of Eventide in my right hand and the
fallen elf scimitar in my left, I was in an irregular equipping state,
which meant I couldn’t use any sword skills. But in a one-on-four
battle, I didn’t want to use any major skills that might lead to a
significant movement delay afterward. On the contrary, having a
sword in each hand gave me more options for defense.
I couldn’t help but think that if I was going to go to these lengths, I
could’ve just kept a shield around for my Quick Change mod, but I
was still just good enough to block the quick, light slashes of the
Fallen with a sword. Plus, I just felt like it suited me, having two
swords so I could pull off a block-and-counter move with either
hand.
207|P

Spinning around, I told myself that if I got through this fight, I should
seriously think about practicing with two swords.
I found the unharmed fourth warrior in front of me, with two more
damaged but fairly healthy warriors coming behind him. The one
whose scimitar I stole rushed back toward his healing comrades,
perhaps to borrow a weapon.
According to their cursors, their HP was already healed back up close
to 70 percent. There was maybe a minute left until they were fully
healed—I had to beat these three before then. But could I do that
without sword skills? I’d already shown them everything I had.
It wasn’t a question of whether I could do it or not. I just had to do it.
Standing still would only get me surrounded, so I focused on the
warrior on the right and charged. They must have learned from my
tendency to attack the sides, however, as they changed directions,
too, to ensure that they were always coming head-on. But if I kept
turning to the right, eventually I would get trapped against the castle
wall.
Do I pull back? No, I don’t have the time. I have to go straight
through, into the melee, and hope I find the route to victory…
I was just about to launch into an all-or-nothing gamble when I heard
a voice.
“Kirito, watch out!!”
For an instant, I thought I was just hearing things. But my body
reacted on instinct, hurtling me to the left.
Crimson red shone past my eyes.
The brightest visual effect I’d seen yet barreled down on the Fallen
Elven Warriors from behind with breathtaking speed. There was a
silhouette in the midst of that light that I couldn’t make out from the

208|P

brightness. The very air roared, and the stones beneath my feet
trembled.
The three warriors turning to follow me noticed the abnormality and
spun around. But by then, the red light was upon them.
“N’wah!” shouted the center warrior, lifting his scimitar. The other
two took similar guarding positions.
Kabooom! With an explosive eruption, the center warrior rose high
in the air. The two at his sides were thrown flat on the ground, and
one tumbled all the way to my feet. Out of sheer reflex, I struck him
with my right-hand sword, whittling away the last bit of his red HP
bar.
I looked up through the exploding blue particles to see the intruder,
blowing past like a runaway freight train, come to a stop in a
whirlwind of dust about six or seven meters away.
A red hooded cape. A pleated skirt of the same color. Long, chestnutbrown hair. I didn’t need to check her cursor to know that this was
Asuna, my temporary partner.
But what sword skill was that just now…? I didn’t recall any charging
attacks that flashy in the Rapier category. The force and range of it
were off the charts in comparison to her favorite, Shooting Star…
“Huh…?!”
The instant I saw it through the dissipating cloud of dust, I gasped.
The weapon Asuna had in her hands was not the Chivalric Rapier she
used but an enormous lance that looked to be at least two meters
long. It had a dark-green leather grip, the body itself was a brilliant
silver, and there was fanciful decoration around the base. It was
clearly quite an excellent weapon based on the design, but my
question was not where she got it, but how she was able to wield it
so well.

209|P

210|P

At present, there were four skills involved with handling spear-type
weapons. One-handed spears, two-handed spears, one-handed
lances, and two-handed lances. Out of those, two-handed spears
were the most typical. There were few spear users overall, but I
could name Cuchulainn of the Legend Braves; Okotan the halberdier
and Hokkai Ikura the trident user from the ALS; and Qusack’s
Highston, who used a glaive. All of those landed under the twohanded spear skill. There were even fewer one-handed spear users—
aside from Schinkenspeck of the ALS, I could only think of one or two
in the front-line group.
But the Lance skill was far rarer in the wild than even those. I had
never yet seen a player on the frontier using a lance.
The reason for this was the small selection of weapons and how
difficult they were to use. The only things that operated under the
Lance skill were lances and guard lances, which had a larger hilt—
both of which could only thrust. Not only were they difficult to wield
in battle, but whether solo, in a party, or in a raid, there were no
situations where a lance was crucial. So in the present SAO, where
there was no room for picking hobby skills, they were a waste of a
good slot…in my opinion.
“Why…? Where…? What…?”
That was all I managed to get out of my mouth from the rapid series
of questions: Why do you have that? Where did you get it? What is
going on with your skills? But Asuna seemed to catch the general gist
of my shock, and when her long delay wore off, she turned to me
and shouted, “I’ll explain later! Watch my back!”
Indeed, with a two-handed lance that was longer than she was tall,
turning around would be difficult. I rushed up toward her, then
remembered that two of the three warriors she’d bowled over were
still alive.

211|P

But I didn’t need to finish them off.
I heard two crystalline ruptures behind my back, nearly in unison.
Looking over my left shoulder through a cloud of texture shards, I
saw Kizmel with her saber and Myia with a rapier.
“Sorry for being late, Kirito!” Kizmel shouted, while Myia nodded her
head, still covered in that leather mask. The side door to the east
wing was in the distance behind them, so they must have come from
that direction. I assumed the skill training had gone well, because I
could see the Meditation buff on their HP bars.
I’d cleaned up the three Fallen Elven Scouts who’d been throwing
their paralyzing needles with abandon, but I couldn’t guarantee that
none of the remaining swordfighters had their own supply of
needles. For the rest of this battle—and every other potential fight
against the fallen elves—we had to have defensive measures against
paralysis.
But these powerful allies coming to our aid at least made this an
even fight. If Asuna could drive one or two of those heavy-charge
attacks into more clumps of enemies, we’d win. I just had to watch
my partner’s back in the meantime.
“How many more seconds on the cooldown, Asuna?!” I yelled, sword
in each hand.
Over my shoulder, I heard her say, “A hundred!”
“Got it!”
Twenty seconds had passed since her charge, so that meant the
cooldown on the skill was two minutes, which was reasonable for a
huge attack like that one. The guards should be able to hold out that
long, plus five or six waitresses from the castle were coming out and
giving potions to the paralyzed and injured guards who weren’t
fighting anymore. Sadly, their medicine didn’t seem capable of

212|P

instantly curing level-2 paralysis, but as long as we could hold the line
where it was now, they would eventually recover.
“Coming from the south, Kirito!”
Kizmel’s voice snapped me back to attention, where four Fallen Elven
Warriors who’d been healing up were heading this way, though their
HP was only at 70 percent or so. The one whose scimitar I’d stolen
was also there, with a borrowed dagger, bringing up the rear.
“Kizmel, Myia, swing around from the sides! Kirito, handle the foes
coming from the north!” Asuna directed. The elf knight and girl
warrior rushed off. After watching them go, I turned around and saw
two Fallen Elven Warriors peel off from the battle in front of the hot
spring pool and race toward us. They were working with the five to
the south in an attempt at a pincer attack.
It was seven on four, but I knew we couldn’t lose. Whittling down the
enemy numbers meant that the defensive line was steadily
recovering strength and pushing back.
“Stay out of this, humans!!”
Two warriors leaped at us, their voices full of rage. I blocked their
perfectly timed slashes with each of my swords. Yellow sparks
burned my eyes, and jolts ran from my elbows to my shoulders, but I
summoned all the strength in my body to resist that pressure. I
promised to watch Asuna’s back, and I would not give a single step.
As soon as I sensed that I’d withstood the full force of the swings, I
used the martial arts leg skill Water Moon, which was the only skill I
could use while holding two one-handed swords. One of the warriors
I kicked in the stomach stumbled but held his ground, while the
other flew off his feet and crashed to the dirt.
On a sudden inspiration, I jammed the scimitar into the earth,
undoing the irregular wielding status, and used my longsword to
activate the Vertical Square sword skill, which had just cleared its
213|P

cooldown period. The warrior before me took all four slices and
exploded after being thrown to the ground.
When I could move again, I pulled out the scimitar and performed a
series of consecutive swings on the other warrior as he rose to his
feet.
Of course, back in the beta, there had been players who tried dual
wielding one-handed swords. A major counterweight to the
drawback of being unable to use sword skills was the fact that
magical bonuses from both weapons would still apply. So if, for
example, I somehow had two copies of my Sword of Eventide, I
would receive a +14 bonus to agility, giving me a huge upgrade in
mobility.
But as far as I knew, by the final day of the beta test, not a single
player had emerged as a master of the art of fighting with two
swords. I’d tried it out, but I found the experience of a sword in each
hand to be jarring, like each half of my body was its own
independent being.
Ultimately, the common understanding in the beta was that, at best,
you could use one sword to defend while using the other to attack,
and at that point, you might as well use a shield instead. And on the
front line in the finished game, I had never seen anyone using two
swords—if you excluded Argo, whose claws were really two weapons
in one. Even in the case of claws, you would only be able to use them
both within the confines of a sword skill.
But in this moment, I had unleashed a string of five or six swings
before I finally realized that I was executing those forbidden
simultaneous attacks. Immediately, I was plagued by that
dissociative feeling again, and I accidentally dropped the scimitar
from my left hand.

214|P

Fortunately, the last swing was enough to reduce the warrior’s HP to
zero. On instinct, I turned my face away from the exploding blue
shards.
That made a total of six fallen elves I’d killed since the start of the
battle. I would think nothing of killing demihuman monsters like
kobolds and ichthyoids by the dozen, but in this case, I felt a kind of
strange pressure weighing on me. I shook my head, dispelling the
feelings of both dissociation and faint guilt, and looked to the south.
Asuna was just about to activate a new sword skill. Her two-handed
lance, glowing green, plunged toward the five fallen elves whom
Kizmel and Myia had maneuvered into one tight bunch. It wasn’t as
powerful as her earlier charge, but her tremendous reach and sharp
point pierced the Fallen anyway. Then she pulled the spear back and
darted it forward again. One more time…a three-part attack.
Once the last metallic sound finished echoing, three of the five fallen
elves were down and bursting apart. The power was devastating; in a
one-on-one fight, the nimble fallen elves would be a formidable
enemy, but in a large group-on-group battle, when you had the
option of trapping your enemy, no weapon could be more effective,
it suddenly seemed to me.
But there was no way she’d learned a two-handed spear skill since
the start of the battle. Based on the power and number of sword
skills she was using, her proficiency with it had to be at least 100.
And now that I thought of it, when we were talking about gained
skills the other day, Asuna had said something odd…
That brief thought was interrupted by a new bursting sound. With
blindingly quick attacks, Kizmel and Myia dispatched the remaining
two foes. The warrior whose scimitar I stole never had the chance to
use the dagger he borrowed. He had turned into fragments of data
and been deleted.

215|P

We had defeated all seven of the warriors who peeled off to attempt
that pincer attack. I turned back to count the number of living
enemies, and a fresh bellow rang across the open courtyard.
“Sulaaaaaa!!”
I panicked at first, but this was not a fresh new batch of enemies, nor
was it more guards coming to the rescue. The dozen-plus dark elf
guards holding a desperate defense in front of the spirit tree’s spring
had all raised a yell together. I could see now that the numbers were
roughly equal in the battle of the defensive line—and if you added
the guards getting healed in the back, we actually had more. The
Fallen commander bellowed to rally his warriors, too, but none
responded in kind.
“Okay, let’s beat that commander and break their…” I started saying
to Asuna when something whizzed past my eyes. Then another…and
another.
“Wha…?” Kizmel gasped and pointed into the sky.
When I followed her finger, I lost all speech.
Against the backdrop of the golden-blue base of the floor of Aincrad
above us, countless little flakes spun and danced through the air.
They were…leaves. The leaves of the spirit tree, which stood over the
courtyard, were withering and falling off the branch.
I automatically reached out and grabbed one before it hit the
ground. It was light brown and desiccated, and it crumbled in my
fingers before melting into thin air.
I looked up again and stared closer at the tree itself, thirty or so
meters above. There was no change to its trunk at this moment, but
the leaves continued falling from its branches in all directions.
This couldn’t be a natural phenomenon. It was January, too late in
the season for the leaves to fall, and the spirit tree had never

216|P

withered because it received constant life from the hot spring at its
roots for centuries…
It was then that my eyes gaped, and I had a terrible premonition.
It couldn’t be a coincidence that the fallen elves were attacking right
as the leaves started falling off the spirit tree. If all the leaves fell, the
“protection of the spirit tree,” as Kizmel called it, would be lost, and
Castle Galey would be the same as the dusty canyon outside its
walls. A weakness debuff would affect all the dark elves in the castle,
and the guards would obviously be unable to fight. But the fallen
elves had those fresh-cut branches on their belts and could keep
going.
That had been their plan all along. And the most likely way they
could harm the spirit tree was…
“Kizmel, do you have your Greenleaf Cape?!” I shouted.
The knight looked back at me, startled out of her shock, but shook
her head. “No…I returned it to the treasure room. Oh! If the spirit
tree withers, then…”
“Right, that’s what they’re after. Here, Kizmel, take this,” I said and,
as quickly as possible, opened my window and took out the branch I
had removed from the Fallen Elven Scout. Kizmel had noticed that
the Fallen were wearing these things, and she looked slightly evasive.
“Did they cut those branches off of living trees…? But how…?”
“I don’t know. But this is the only option you have…If all the spirit
tree’s leaves fall, I don’t think the guards will be able to fight
anymore.”
I pressed the leafy branch into the knight’s hand, then turned to
Asuna with her huge lance and Myia in her gas mask. I couldn’t help
but feel very worried about Asuna being here. But Kizmel wouldn’t
abandon her comrades, and in any case, Asuna would not run away.

217|P

“Just hang in there…I’ll be right back!”
“Where are you going, Kirito…?!”
“Underground!” I shouted as I ran off.
In moments, I was at full speed, racing through the falling leaves. The
guards had paused when the abnormal phenomenon started and
were starting to fight again, but the leaves would be gone within
three minutes. There were still fifteen Fallen Elven Warriors,
including their commander, and even with the three women present,
it would be tough to eliminate them all within three minutes. I had to
stop the withering of the spirit tree before then.
I readied my sword above my right shoulder, hoping to add at least
one blow before I left. I steadied my aim, hearing the start-up sound
of the sword skill, and activated Sonic Leap. It scored a clean hit on
the back of a warrior standing apart from his group, sending him
tumbling. I grabbed the branch from his belt.
“Aim for the branches on the Fallen’s backs!” I shouted to the
guards—and so that the Fallen would hear me, too—and rushed past
the fighting toward the front entrance of the castle. No doubt it
would be difficult to aim for the branches on the enemy’s backs in
the midst of battle, but at the very least, it should put some mental
pressure on the Fallen. If they lost those branches, they would be
just as susceptible to weakness when the spirit tree died.
I reached the entryway in seconds and handed over the branch I just
stole to the waitresses helping the injured and paralyzed right next
to the door. “If the spirit tree withers, gather everyone close around
that branch!”
The range of the branch’s effect would be very short, I was certain,
but still enough to make a difference. Once the waitresses nodded,
stunned, I rushed inside.

218|P

The first-floor entry hall was empty. Most likely, Count Galeyon and
the high priests were barricading themselves up on the top floor. I
didn’t think they were going to hear out some human wanderer the
way that Viscount Yofilis did, and if the tree withered, the count
would be just as helpless as the rest of them anyway.
The stairs down to the underground hot spring were a little ways
down the west wing hallway. I curved to the left and was speeding
up again when I heard a familiar voice.
“Hey! Boy! Slow down!”
“…?!”
I went into a double-footed brake and looked up in the direction of
the voice. On the second-floor terrace of the stairs in the atriumstyle entry hall was a figure in a black robe, hands waving wildly.
“G…Gramps?! What do you want? There’s no time for…”
But Bouhroum, the self-styled “great sage,” cut me off with a
desperate “I know that! I suspect the Fallen have dumped poison in
the spring, and I know you’re going down there! But you cannot fix it
by yourself!”
“Th-then what can we do…?”
“Pour this into the spring!” he said, tossing something that looked
like it was made of glass from the terrace.
If this was a quest with a proper storyline, then failing to catch the
object would immediately fail the quest, I knew, so I dropped my
sword and used both hands to catch the ball of glass.
It turned out to be a round-bottomed flask about ten centimeters
across. There was a cork plugged tight into its short neck, and it was
full of a deep-green liquid. Based on appearances, it was very
poisonous.

219|P

I wanted to ask him if this was really safe, but there wasn’t a second
to waste. Deciding to take the word of the sage for properly training
Asuna and the others in the Meditation skill, I picked up my sword
and made to leave.
“All right, I’ll do it!”
“Very good, boy!”
With that, I resumed running. A downward staircase appeared on
the right side of the hall, and I practically tumbled down the steps to
the basement. I had to be as cautious as possible while running down
the hallway with its reddish lamps. The Fallen could be lurking
anywhere from this point on.
At the end of the curving corridor was the large door to the
underground hot spring. White steam wafted out from the open
door.
“Ooh…”
I covered my mouth with my sword hand on instinct. Before, it had
only smelled like spring water, but now there was an unpleasant
odor mixed in. Something like drying mud—a musty, moldy smell.
I stopped at the entrance, listening closely before I entered. There
was no one in the spacious lounge area, but the stench was sharper
here. If the smell was coming from the pool the spirit tree’s roots
drank from, there wasn’t a moment to waste. I threw open the far
door, raced through the empty changing room, and went into the
great subterranean dome…
“…!!”
I clenched my jaw when I saw it.
The pure, milky-white water of the spring was tainted and black.
Thick, sticky bubbles rose to the surface, emitting a gray miasma
when they burst. The roots hanging from the domed ceiling were
220|P

nearly four-fifths black, no doubt due to sucking up the polluted
water. If I didn’t purify that water now, that centuries-old tree was
going to die within a minute.
But I couldn’t move forward.
Ahead of me on the stone tile walkway, near the lip of the water,
stood a man.
He wore full-metal armor, a shortspear in his right hand, and a tower
shield in his left. His face was aged, and his chin sported a short
beard.
It was the leader of Qusack, Gindo.
The spearman eyed me warily.
“Get out of the way,” I said.
But Gindo just pointed his large shield in my direction and rasped,
“No…I can’t move until those roots have completely rotted away.”
That made it essentially certain that Gindo had dumped the poison
into the hot spring. But the color cursor over his head was green. So
whoever went into the gate room of the tower and either killed or
drove out the dark elf guard so that the gate would stay open, it
wasn’t him. It must have been one of his three other companions.
In any case, Qusack had me fooled entirely. Bitter regret and sour
hate flooded my mouth. “Are you…helping the fallen elves? Or are
you part of that PK gang…?”
Whatever I expected out of Gindo, it wasn’t this. “No way…neither!
I…we didn’t even know that people were PKing in Aincrad. So I…I
never suspected him of…”
“…Him? Who…?”
But I didn’t have time to keep talking. There wasn’t a second to
waste. In the courtyard just above us, Asuna, Kizmel, Myia, and the
221|P

guards were fighting desperately to save the castle. From what I
could see on their HP bars, they hadn’t lost too much, but if the spirit
tree died, and the guards could no longer fight, my party members
would be in grave danger.
“…I don’t have time to talk with you. If you don’t move now,” I said,
lifting my sword and pointing it at the man who stood five meters
away, “I will move you by force.”
If I attacked Gindo, who had a green cursor, mine would turn orange.
But I would do the alignment recovery quest as many times as it took
to keep Asuna and the others alive.
In response, Gindo adjusted his tower shield, which stood over one
meter tall. He wasn’t going to budge until that tree had withered up.
It wouldn’t be easy to break through his defense, but if it came down
to it, I could use a series of sword skills to smash the shield…
An idea popped into my head, and I looked at the sword in my right
hand.
I returned it to the sheath over my back without a word, opened my
window, and put the flask in my inventory. When he saw me
barehanded, Gindo let a flash of uncertainty cross his face that I did
not miss.
Instantly, I was flying. Gindo frantically tried to raise his shortspear,
but I jumped to the right, hunching into the blind spot his large shield
created. Then I darted forward again, putting both hands on the
shield and pushing with all my might.
Within the Anti-Criminal Code zone, even the strongest player could
not force other players or NPCs out of their personal space. The
action of planting your feet in place fixed your personal coordinates
and made the game treat you like any other immovable object.
But outside the safe-haven area, that system did not apply. And even
I did not know where the line between simply pushing a person and
222|P

committing a crime lay. If you pushed someone off a high ledge and
caused fall damage, you would definitely turn orange, but this
seemed safe to me…
“Yaaaah!”
I bellowed, summoning all the power from my gut, and pushed on
the heavily armored warrior, whose gear had to be twice the weight
of my own. Out of a difference of strength or simple surprise, Gindo
faltered backward and couldn’t recover, sliding bit by bit. He put up a
brief moment of resistance at the lip of the walkway, then fell back
first into the filthy black water.
A huge plume of liquid shot up, and then Gindo’s face emerged from
the water.
“Bwah!”
He spat and flailed his hands, but because of the weight of his plate
armor and tower shield, he couldn’t keep himself afloat. Fortunately
(I supposed), the blackened water was smelly but apparently not
poisonous to players, because no debuff icon appeared on his cursor.
Belatedly, I realized that if his HP ended up going down, I could have
gone criminal, but at least for now, I wasn’t suffering any alignment
loss.
I ran my fingers across my open window and materialized the flask
I’d just placed in it. Quickly, I popped the cork out and poured the
green liquid into the hot water.
White smoke practically exploded out of the water where it landed,
causing me to turn my face away. Gindo’s struggling figure was
engulfed in the smoky steam. The reaction quickly spread across the
vast pool of water, painting white over my entire field of view.
It reminded me of a prank I played as a kid with my little sister
Suguha, when we dumped a huge block of dry ice into the
bathwater.
223|P

“…I hope you know what you’re talking about, Gramps,” I muttered.
There was no response, of course, but a few seconds later, the first
change I noticed was not in the sight of the spring, but the smell. The
stench hanging thick in the dome rapidly began to reverse, replaced
by a fresh, woody smell, like a forest after the rain. Eventually, the
white cloud dispersed, allowing me to see once again.
Within moments, the poisonous swamp of the hot spring underwent
a dramatic transformation. The greenish water was now clear again,
the paved stone floor crisply visible, and the nasty smell was
completely gone. The bundles of hanging roots from the ceiling were
still blackened at the top, but even that was slowly fading. It seemed
that we had avoided the nightmare scenario of the spirit tree
withering away completely.
I checked the HP bars of my party members again and, satisfied they
were still holding out at around 70 percent, breathed a sigh of relief.
A dark elf victory was surely guaranteed at this point, but with other
players involved, there was no telling what might happen next. I had
to return to the courtyard and help eliminate the Fallen.
I turned on my heel, then paused and looked back to Gindo, who was
no longer struggling. The heavy warrior, resting on his knees in the
water, turned his face up toward mine, and at the bare minimum of
volume needed to be audible, muttered, “Now…they’re all going to
die.”
“What…? Who is?” I asked.
His face was sunken, like the soul had drained out of it, with just a
touch of anger and despair.
“Who do you think? My friends. Lazuli, Temuo, Highston…They’ve
been given poison. They’re being held prisoner.”

224|P

BY THE TIME I GOT BACK TO THE COURTYARD OF Castle Galey, there
were only three Fallen Elven Warriors left. Unsurprisingly, one was
the commander with the long saber. The actual surprise was who I
saw them fighting with.
Decked out in shining silver armor and a blue cape, swinging a
slender longsword, was none other than the master of the castle,
Count Melan Gus Galeyon. He’d lost nearly 20 percent of his health,
and his swinging was rusty, but the Fallen commander was down in
the red, and I wasn’t worried about a comeback. The other two
enemies were surrounded by guards. The majority of the spirit tree’s
leaves had fallen from overhead, but at least the damage had
stopped.
A quick scan of the courtyard showed me that Asuna, Kizmel, and
Myia were helping the servants tend to the wounded. I also saw
Bouhroum nearby.
When I rushed over, the sage was as self-important as ever. “It’s
good to see you know how to follow directions, boy. I had to break
into little Melan’s bedchamber to rouse him from his hiding place
and shame him into joining the battle.”
I watched the old man cackle, then looked to Count Galeyon fighting
bravely—and back. “Actually…since you’re wiser and greater than
the master of the castle, I have a request of you…”
“Hmm? And what would that be?” Bouhroum asked suspiciously.
I leaned over to his long ear, partially hidden behind his white
whiskers, and whispered, “Give me the four keys you’re keeping in
the treasure room.”
“Wha…?!” the old man started to shout, until I covered his open
mouth with my hand.
225|P

“Please! My friends…er, more like some acquaintances, are in mortal
danger. I’ll give them back once I’ve saved them!”
In the moment, I completely forgot that the old man in front of me
was an NPC.
If I had been thinking straight, I would know that an NPC acting along
rules laid out for him would never assist in an act of thievery. But the
last few days, the actions and statements of the NPCs we’d met
didn’t have that same sense of programming. There was something
too human about the way they acted.
Count Galeyon, who was fighting the commander of the Fallen now,
had seemed like nothing more than a quest-giving NPC when we first
met him, reciting canned lines as directed. But watching him now,
the way he fought awkwardly but with hints of desperation, painted
a vivid portrait of a man with a pampered upbringing doing his best
to live up to his lordly role, inexperienced at combat but spurred on
by his stern elderly teacher. Earlier, I had thought that Kizmel and
Viscount Yofilis were the only special NPCs I’d met, but after
Bouhroum and Myia, it began to feel as though all the NPCs living in
Aincrad were actually like that.
Bouhroum answered my plea with a fierce glare and a grumble.
“Hrrrmmmm…”
“Look, I know it’s a crazy request. But it’s the only way…”
“Hmm. Very well, then.”
Huh?!
It was that simple, apparently. He glanced at Asuna, who was feeding
a guard a potion, and muttered, “The lance I lent to that young lady
came from the treasure room, too. Wait right here.”
Bouhroum turned, black robes twirling, and began running for the
front entrance. Gindo had been watching from the shadow of the

226|P

massive door and pulled his face back in a hurry, but the old man
paid him no mind and disappeared into the castle.
Just then, there was a great cheer across the courtyard. Count
Galeyon had defeated the enemy commander. At last, the two
remaining warriors threw down their scimitars and surrendered.
We had successfully avoided the collapse of Castle Galey, but the
fight wasn’t over yet. The unnamed man who had abducted three
members of Qusack and threatened the remaining one into opening
the gates needed to be dealt with, once and for all.
I took a deep, slow breath, let it out, and headed toward Asuna to
explain the situation to the others in my party.
Five minutes later, I was rushing quickly through the dusty canyon
outside Castle Galey with Asuna, Kizmel, and Myia in tow.
Thirty meters ahead was Gindo, lighter now that he had removed his
tower shield and plate armor. I warned him that he’d be in great
danger if the monsters attacked him while alone, and therefore he
shouldn’t run, but his pace was clearly picking up. The giant
arthropods that populated the canyon used vibration for targeting
more than sight, so you could avoid them by being quiet and careful,
but he was beyond caring about that.
I understood how he felt, but if he drew the attention of monsters,
we’d have to step in to save him, and that would cause trouble if the
enemy saw us. I didn’t see anyone scouting out up ahead, but there
were dozens of little hollows and shadows that a player could be
hiding in.
“…By the way, whatever happened with that dark elf escort that
Qusack had around?” Asuna wondered.
I repeated what Gindo had told me. “He died in battle when they got
attacked by monsters in this canyon, apparently…That’s when an
unfamiliar man showed up and saved them, according to him, but
227|P

I’m betting that he rounded up those monsters and set them on
Qusack in the first place.”
“Is this the same man who killed Myia’s father and tried to kill you
and Asuna?” Kizmel asked.
Without thinking, I put a hand on Myia’s shoulder and nodded.
“Technically, I’m thinking of the boss of the people who killed Cylon.
Asuna and I call him the man in the black poncho. He usually doesn’t
fight for himself but plots in secret and sets people and groups
against one another.”
“Ah…He sounds like one of the demons of the ancient myths.”
“D…demons?”
That reminded me that I still hadn’t seen any real demonic-type
monsters yet in Aincrad. I glanced over at Kizmel, and she nodded
and continued, “Deep underground in the earth of old, there was a
subterranean realm where wicked demons and devils were said to
live. Occasionally, they would rise to the surface, disguising
themselves as beautiful humans and elves, and, by taking the places
of nobles or military leaders, would then sow discord among the
innocent.”
“Yikes…that sounds exactly like the black-poncho man,” Asuna, on
my left, remarked with disgust. “I…I hope he’s not a real demon…”
I couldn’t tell if she was talking about the man in the black poncho
being not a player but an NPC from some long-dormant demon race
of Aincrad, or if she was suggesting he might be a real-life demon
wearing a NerveGear and logging in to SAO. Obviously, I wasn’t going
to ask, so I focused on Gindo’s back far ahead of us.
“Once we pull that poncho’s hood off, we’ll know,” I said, half-joking.

228|P

To my surprise, Myia nodded and said, “When I was little, Mother
read me a story that had a demon in it. I think that if he has pointy
horns on his head, he is a demon.”
It sounded like an innocuous comment, but she was talking about
the boss of the people who killed her father. And I had to repay him
for sticking a knife to my back in the streets of Karluin. It was tough
enough just trying to beat these floors; we didn’t need to deal with a
bunch of PKers trying to stir up trouble on top of that. If the man in
the black poncho had kidnapped the rest of Qusack on his own, then
this would be the perfect chance to settle the score with him—once
the other three were safe, of course.
“Whether demon or human, he’s a dangerous foe. I’m looking
forward to your help, Myia, even though I know you’re tired.” I
patted her on the shoulder and let go. The little girl in the gas mask
nodded, as did Kizmel and Asuna.
In all honesty, what I really wanted to do was take Asuna aside and
ask her about the two-handed lance skill, but it was hard to talk
about game systems in front of the NPCs. When I came back from
the hot spring to the courtyard, there was no sign of the giant lance
that Bouhroum had supposedly taken from the treasure repository,
but I bet it was in Asuna’s inventory, so there would be another
chance to ask. Everything could wait until we’d rescued Lazuli,
Temuo, and Highston.
According to Gindo, after the swarm of monsters attacked and the
dark elf bodyguard died, a cloud of odd-smelling smoke had swept
through, along with a voice that said “This way.” They ran in that
direction to escape, where they saw a “handsome player with a
charming smile,” who then guided them to a cave at the end of the
canyon. Once they’d relaxed, knowing they were safe, the man had
handed them potions, which paralyzed them.

229|P

Then he dragged Gindo out of the cave, and with the same smile,
told him the conditions he needed to fulfill to recover his guildmates.
Gindo would return to Castle Galey alone and poison the
underground hot spring. Then, once all the dark elves in the castle
died, he could return. Alternately, if the fallen elves all died in the
attack, he could steal the four sacred keys from the treasure
chamber during the chaos of the battle and deliver them to the cave.
Only when one of those conditions was fulfilled would his friends be
returned to him alive…
When Gindo finished explaining the situation, my first thought—
recollection, really—was of the former blacksmith and chakram user
of the Legend Braves, Nezha.
He had described the man in the black poncho who brought the
upgrade-scam idea to the Legend Braves as a movie star–beautiful
man with a pleasant smile. I’d never seen his face myself, but it
seemed obvious that Gindo’s “handsome player with a charming
smile” was the same person. How charismatic did this guy have to be
to get so many players to drop their guard around him?
Maybe he really was a de—
But I had to stop myself from thinking that. Whether demon or
human, if he had an HP bar, he could be defeated. I had hesitated
when I fought Morte, but I wouldn’t make that mistake twice. I’d
killed six fallen elves in the battle at Castle Galey, even knowing that
there was no fundamental difference between their lives and the
lives of players in this world.
Up ahead, Gindo pointed his shortspear upward and changed course.
That was the signal that the destination was close. It had only been
ten minutes since leaving the castle, and even avoiding battle, we
hadn’t covered much more than half a kilometer. A giant scorpion
plodded along the right side of the ravine, so we snuck past it,

230|P

hugging the left wall, and came to a stop at the branching path Gindo
had gone down.
We peered in, hunched together, and saw that the path came to an
end just twenty meters or so in, with a yawning cave mouth in the
middle of the rock face. That would be where the other members
were held captive. Gindo opened his window outside the entrance,
equipped his plate armor and shield, and started walking in.
If the man in the black poncho or his friends were near the cave’s
entrance, he was supposed to raise his spear to point up again, but it
was still dangling toward the ground. Our plan was for Gindo to
exchange the four keys for his companions, and once the other three
emerged safely from the cave, we would charge inside. The cave was
a dead end, too, so we didn’t have to worry about the poncho man
escaping.
It was possible that the black assassin would take the keys and
immediately break his promise, but if so, we would rush in
immediately. Gindo was registered in our party now, so I could see
his HP in real-time, and given his defensive focus, even an enemy
over level 20 couldn’t kill him in a single instant.
Gindo slowly approached the cave. As soon as he crossed the
threshold between orange sunset-lit sand and the shadow from the
tall cliffs, the spearman sank into dark gray.
“…Hey, Kirito,” murmured Asuna to calm her nerves as she crouched
below me, “I’ve been wondering…it’s the fallen elves who want the
hidden keys, and the man in the black poncho is helping them with
that, right?”
“Hmm…I suppose so. He shouldn’t have any particular interest in the
warfare between the two groups of elves. Maybe in exchange for
helping the Fallen, he and his buddies have been getting those
daggers and paralyzing needles?”

231|P

“But the fallen elves who attacked at Myia’s house in Stachion were
after the iron keys that you and she carry. They’re only related to
Stachion’s curse, so why would the Fallen want them? You don’t
think those iron keys are the two remaining sacred keys, do you?”
“No…that can’t be the case,” said Kizmel, who was practically leaning
onto my back to peer down the canyon tributary. “The Ruby Key and
Adamantine Key are safely contained in the shrines on the seventh
and eighth floors. No human would know the location of the shrines
or what to do with the keys should they find them.”
“Yeah…good point,” I said, choosing not to point out that the first
half of her statement was definitely untrue. Any player who beat the
“Elf War” campaign quest in the beta would know where the
seventh- and eighth-floor shrines were—like me.
But the two iron keys had been in the possession of Myia’s mother,
Theano, and Lord Cylon, not players, and only elves could go up
floors while the labyrinth tower of the sixth floor was still
unconquered. So if the keys Myia and I had were not the sacred keys,
but the fallen elves wanted them for some reason, that meant…
Just then, Myia piped up from below Asuna. “Oh…look, everyone…”
I returned my attention to the back of the canyon. Gindo still wasn’t
in the cave; for some reason, he was standing still a few meters from
the entrance. Either he’d spotted something, or…
But the premonition I felt was immediately disproved—a familiar
bunch of faces emerged from the darkness of the cave.
The ponytailed woman was Lazuli. The shaved-headed one was
Temuo, and the long-haired one was Highston. Their weapons were
taken away, but their armor was the same. The awkward wobbling in
their steps wasn’t an effect of the paralyzing poison but probably a
mental thing.

232|P

I was relieved at first that the other three were safe, but then I
became very suspicious.
Gindo hadn’t given the man in the black poncho the four keys yet.
Why were the hostages released? Were the keys just an excuse, and
all he really wanted was the gate of Castle Galey opened?
But the fallen elves were defeated, and the spirit tree had just barely
survived. Nearly ten of the guards had perished, but I doubt that was
the extent of what he wanted to achieve.
It didn’t add up, but at least the rest of Qusack were safe. Gindo
tossed his shield aside and rushed to them, taking their hands. After
rejoicing in their reunion, he turned and waved to us.
“…I suppose there’s no reason to hide anymore,” Asuna said. I
agreed and straightened up. Once Myia had stood up from the
gravel, we headed into the branching path. At the end of the little
ravine, Gindo greeted us with a teary smile.
“Thank you…thank you so much. Because of you, we’re all alive and
well.”
“No…we didn’t do anything…” I said, scratching my head.
Highston, who looked a bit on the pale side but had nearly full HP,
said, “The man who poisoned us left the cave about five minutes
ago. I think he knew you guys were trailing Gin, and he ran off. So
you see, it is thanks to you.”
“…Well, if he knew we were following, that’s a problem in itself,” I
muttered, looking around. Five minutes was a tricky amount of
time—enough to cover a good distance at a sprint, but at walking
speed, he might still be close. Then again, the cave and the branching
path were a dead end, so if he’d taken a leisurely exit, we would
have seen him.

233|P

“Did it seem like the black-poncho man got a message before he
left?” Asuna asked. Lazuli shook her head.
“No, he was totally quiet after he took Gin out, and he pricked us
with these poison needle things every now and then…then, a little
while ago, he just stood up and left the cave. When the paralysis
wore off, and we stepped out, there was Gin…”
“……Oh…”
But there was still suspicion in Asuna’s features. Kizmel and Myia
were looking around a slight distance away, as if they didn’t feel
entirely safe. If the black-poncho man was using his Hiding skill
nearby, it should be impossible for him to sneak up on us in this
place without drawing attention, but there were no sure things in
this world.
Meanwhile, Gindo seemed totally relieved and relaxed. He walked
over to me, blinking rapidly, and bowed. “I owe you all so much for
this. This experience has been a painful lesson…We weren’t ready for
the front line yet. We’ll go back to the fifth floor, finish up the quests
that are left, and build ourselves up from scratch again…Oh, right.
You can have these back.”
He opened his window and produced a small leather bag. I peered
inside and saw the green, blue, yellow, and black sacred keys.
“All accounted f…”
I paused. If he had switched the keys out for fakes in his inventory,
there was no way for me to discern the difference. I couldn’t rule out
the possibility that they were aligned with the man in the black
poncho and that this was all a big act to steal the keys from us.
“…Um, hang on. Sorry, can I just check something?” I asked, but
Gindo didn’t seem upset at all.
“Sure, of course.”

234|P

“Okay…” I said, then beckoned Kizmel over and showed her the bag.
“Can you check to see if these are the real keys or not?”
“I can do this, but as I said earlier—” the knight began with a shrug—
when just to our left, the sand erupted upward from the ground.
“…?!”
I leaped back to see the reddish-brown sand being sucked up into a
little vortex. A whirlwind? But I’d never seen that happen in these
canyons before…
The moment I saw the dull shine in the midst of the two-meter-tall
sandstorm, I shouted “Defense!!” and pulled out my Sword of
Eventide, gripping it with both hands.
I held the sword in front of me and positioned Asuna behind my
back; at my side, Kizmel drew her saber and took position in front of
Myia. The members of Qusack were farther away—all I could do was
hope that Gindo used his huge shield to protect his friends.
The sand whirlwind split top and bottom without a sound, and
crimson light shot forth.
It was a sword skill. A rotating area attack—the scimitar’s Treble
Scythe…except, it wasn’t.
No, this was the heavy area attack of the Katana skill, Tsumujiguruma.
Deep, almost unprecedented shock shattered what few thoughts I
could manage. I held my sword in both hands but couldn’t brace
myself. Sparks burst before my eyes, an incredible jolt ran from my
wrists through my shoulders, and my back collided with Asuna as we
flew a good six meters and sprawled onto the gravel.
I rolled several times and managed to stop on my knees. I’d guarded
the attack itself but still lost about 20 percent health, and on the
ground nearby, Asuna was down 10 percent. Kizmel managed to stay
235|P

on her feet, but she’d been pushed back a good distance in her
defensive position, and Myia had fallen onto her bottom behind her.
A glance over my left shoulder showed me that Qusack had fallen
back but was otherwise fine…except that the top quarter of Gindo’s
tower shield was gone.
Ahead, the sand had fallen back to earth, revealing our attacker.
It was not the man in the black poncho.
The figure’s body was thinner than Kizmel and wrapped in studded
dark-gray leather. A hood of the same color covered shoulder to
head, but the figure was clearly feminine. Her weapon, outstretched
after the swing, was indeed a katana. It was only the second time I
had seen that rare weapon type in the launch version, after the huge
nodachi used by the first-floor boss, Illfang the Kobold Lord.
The attacker straightened up from her deep kneeling position with
feathery lightness and pulled the hood off with her free hand. Ashgray hair fell over her forehead, shining brilliantly in the setting sun.
Her bangs were longer on the left side from my perspective, hiding
nearly half her face but not her stunning beauty. I searched for her
color cursor.
It was…a blackish-red the color of dried blood. Her name was
Kysarah: Fallen Elven Adjutant.
I recognized that name. It was the woman elf who had been with
Fallen General N’ltzahh when we saw him in the submerged dungeon
on the fourth floor. And it was only at this point that I realized I’d left
one big mystery unsolved until now.
Gindo had fallen into the black-poncho man’s trap with his
companions held hostage and returned to Castle Galey alone as
ordered. The guards had opened the gate for him without
skepticism, because he had the sigil ring. That was the moment the

236|P

ordinary gate bell had woken me up in the dining hall. I recalled that
it turned into the rapid warning bell barely ten seconds after that.
It was impossible for a whole battalion of fallen elves to race all the
way through the canyon to the castle gate in ten seconds. As I
initially supposed, someone must have passed through the gate with
Gindo and killed the dark elf in the gate room. But that person never
made an appearance during the battle, leaving me guessing to the
end.
Now I knew that this katana-wielding woman was the one who had
attacked the gate room. I didn’t know why she hadn’t taken part in
the battle in the courtyard, but it was quite possible that if she had,
the Fallen would have won.
The elf looked around with bluish-purple eyes like ice in darkness,
then stuck the end of her black katana into the sand nearby. When
she raised it again, it lifted up the leather bag that fell from my left
hand when we were attacked. She flipped it up into the air and
caught it, four sacred keys still contained within.
“……Thirty of my brethren died so I could gain these…”
The voice that came from her thin lips contained a sweetness in the
midst of its harsh bite. The moment she heard that, Kizmel recovered
from her frozen shock and brandished her saber.
“You…you’re General N’ltzahh’s aide, Kysarah the Ransacker!” she
shouted. “Return that bag to the ground! It is not meant to be
touched by the likes of you!”
But Kysarah did not bat an eyelash. She fixed Kizmel with that icy
gaze and answered in a flat affect, “Knight of Lyusula, I am afraid I do
not know your name. And I will not be returning the keys…They are
necessary for the sake of our great desire.”

237|P

“Then I will force you to return them…by my sword!” Kizmel said,
already charging. In my head, I knew I should be attacking at this
same moment, but my avatar wouldn’t listen to me.
Kizmel’s attack was tremendous, worthy of the title of royal guard. It
wasn’t a sword skill, yet the tip of the saber as it cut through virtual
air shone silver, and the breeze it created brushed my face, many
meters away.
Claaang! There was a nasty ringing, along with a sound like metal
screaming.
“…!”
I heard Asuna gasp into my left ear. The moment Kysarah lifted her
katana with one easy motion to block the attack, a crack ran down
the length of Kizmel’s saber blade. It was a sign that a weapon’s
durability was just about to run out.

238|P

239|P

Kizmel floated backward, gnashing her teeth. She still had the saber
at the ready, but one more good blow would easily shatter it.
Kysarah, meanwhile, lowered her katana with nary a care and stuck
the bag of keys into her waist pouch. Her gaze traveled from Kizmel
to Asuna and me, then to the members of Qusack. At the foot of her
knee-high boots, another little dust devil kicked up…and then she
moved with alarming speed, stopping right next to Gindo’s group.
“Aaah! Aaaaaaah!” screamed Temuo. Kysarah grabbed him by the
back collar of his breastplate with her free hand and easily hoisted
him up. He swung his arms around, struggling to break free, but went
absolutely still the moment she pressed the tip of her katana to his
throat.
“…I can kill you all right now, but I do not have a taste for murdering
children, and my branch is about to run out of life.”
Belatedly, I realized that Kysarah had one of those tree branches
behind her back, too. If I could steal that, then Kysarah would suffer
the weakness debuff and be unable to move, since she did not have
a Greenleaf Cape like Kizmel did.
But I also couldn’t move with the katana at Temuo’s neck. If he were
a player of Kysarah’s level, his HP couldn’t be reduced to zero in a
single instant, even if she attacked a vital point. But based on the
strength of the katana, which nearly destroyed Kizmel’s saber in one
hit, and the fact that to my level-21 eyes, her cursor was nearly
black, she might indeed be able to inflict an instantly fatal blow.
“Among you, there are two other keys, not sacred but made of iron,
that fit together as one,” Kysarah said, still dangling Temuo in the air.
It took me an extra second to understand what she meant. My
shoulders twitched inadvertently, and Kysarah turned her visible
blue-purple eye right on me. “You will give them to me, too. For

240|P

every ten seconds that I do not have them, I will kill one of your
acquaintances.”
Temuo promptly struggled again, and Lazuli uttered a quick scream.
Highston, who was sitting on his knees in the sandy gravel, looked
from Kysarah to me and back and said in a tremulous falsetto,
“This…this is a forced event from the “Elf War” quest, right?!
Someone’s…someone’s gonna save us, right?!”
I wanted to believe so. But I was pretty sure—no, dead sure—that
this attack did not have anything to do with the proper story scenario
of the campaign. It was an irregular outcome as a result of the blackponcho man and his PK gang making contact with the elves. It was an
incident.
…Seven…Eight.
When the count inside my head reached nine, I bolted to my feet.
“All right. I’ll give you the keys.”
Once I said so, I realized that Kysarah was an NPC, and she might
carry out the ten-second limit in a very literal sense. If she didn’t
receive the keys within ten seconds and have their ownership
transferred to her in the system, she might slaughter Temuo without
mercy…At least, if this were a fully scripted event.
But ten seconds had already passed by the time I told her I’d give her
the keys, and she merely nodded and didn’t move her katana.
Convinced anew that this was not some pre-scripted event, I moved
as quickly as I could in pulling the iron key out of storage anyway.
I tossed it into the sand at Kysarah’s feet, and another one flew
forward from behind me, sticking into the surface near the first. That
was the key Myia got from her mother. The keys faced each other at
a distance of about a third of a meter, ringing and reverberating.
Kysarah glanced down, then tossed Temuo toward his friends with
one hand. Gindo opened his arms but failed to catch the man, and
241|P

they crashed backward onto the ground. There was no HP loss,
fortunately.
The fallen elf crouched, all interest in her hostage lost, and reached
out for the closer of the two keys. Suddenly, I was keenly aware of
the weight of the sword in my right hand.
If Kysarah picked up the two keys with one hand, there would be a
repelling reaction between them, like we saw in the castle library,
and they would forcefully hurl each other apart. That would be our
only chance at a counterattack. I could hit her with every blow of a
Vertical Square and not take her out, but if I could get one good blow
in and throw her off-balance, there should be a chance to steal the
branch from her backside.
Kysarah scooped up the first key. I adjusted my center of gravity just
a bit forward.
Right at that moment, someone grabbed my ankle.
“…?!”
I spun around and looked directly into Asuna’s wide eyes. She didn’t
say a word or make any other kind of gesture, but it was very clear
that my temporary partner was warning me not to move.
I looked forward again. As I expected, Kysarah had picked up one key
and was reaching with the same hand for the other. The resonating
ring grew much louder, but the fallen elf paid it no heed and grabbed
the second key, too.
Bzak!! That odd sound happened again, and a silver light shot from
Kysarah’s hand—but the two keys did not fly in opposite directions.
Kysarah squeezed them tightly in her palm, as though she had been
expecting that to happen.
Her ash-gray hair rippled with the force of the light shooting
between her fingers. The bangs that covered the right side of her

242|P

face were pushed away briefly, too, enough that I could see for the
first time that she had a small eyepatch over her right eye, but my
mind snapped right back to that hand.
Her lips clamped shut, Kysarah continued to clench the two keys
together with astonishing force. In the meantime, she had her katana
pointed toward us, so there was no chance for us to sneak attack
her.
Eventually, there was a larger sparking sound, and the silver light
faded and went out.
Kysarah rose to her feet, holding what was now a single iron key. She
hadn’t fused them together physically from sheer hand strength, of
course; as Bouhroum said, the teeth and heads of the two keys were
meant to align perfectly.
“I had heard that there was a strange charm placed upon them…”
she muttered, tossing the key into the bag with the four others. Then
she straightened out her disheveled hair and turned to us. “Now my
business here is done. Human warriors…”
She paused then, her slender brows twitching just the tiniest bit.
“Do not involve yourself in elf matters any further. Let them be the
only ones to bring trouble into this,” she huffed, placing the black
katana into the sheath on her left hip and spreading her arms. The
wind whipped up from her feet and formed a little sand whirlwind
that swallowed her whole.
I turned my face away from the stinging wind for just a second, and
the swirling dispersed, dropping the sand to the ground. The katanawielding fallen elf was gone.
“…I think we’re giving up on the elf quest. If that sort of stuff is going
to happen farther down the line, I can’t imagine us getting all the
way to the end,” Gindo said.

243|P

And with that, the members of Qusack left for the exit of the dusty
ravine. They were going to use the teleport gate in Stachion to go
back to the fifth floor, where they would discuss their plans for the
future, they explained. Temuo, Lazuli, and Highston had lost their
weapons to the man in the black poncho, but they said they had
backup weapons in their inventories, so they could get safely back to
town.
As for me, I wanted to apologize to Qusack for suspecting them of
being aligned with the fallen elves during the battle to defend Castle
Galey. I was hoping to exchange more info with them and didn’t
want to say goodbye just yet, but Lazuli said, “Thank you for saving
us. We’ll find a way to make it up to you once things have settled
down,” so I had a feeling we’d meet again.
Once the four were out of sight, I walked over to Kizmel, looked her
in the face up close, and bowed deeply. “I’m sorry, Kizmel. You did all
that work to gather the keys…”
But that was all I was able to get out. Kizmel bent over at the waist,
too, and said gravely, “Kirito, Asuna, forgive me. It was my job to
keep you two safe…”
Our heads brushed together, and we awkwardly snapped upright
again. Asuna giggled.
“There’s nothing for you to apologize about, Kizmel. Besides, I don’t
think you came up inferior to that fallen elf. She just had a much
fancier weapon than you.”
Kizmel looked up and grimaced. “The official swords of the Pagoda
Royal Knights are not cheap trinkets…but mine nearly broke from
trading a single blow with her. That comes down to the inferiority of
my technique.”
“Don’t say that,” I reassured. “I wasn’t able to attack her, either.”

244|P

Then it was Asuna’s turn to look apologetic. “Sorry about grabbing
your ankle, Kirito. You were waiting for a chance to strike back,
weren’t you?”
“Oh…Actually, you made the right choice. I was going to leap at
Kysarah the moment she picked up the keys, but it was like she knew
they were going to push each other apart…so if I’d jumped in, she
would have sliced me up instead.”
“I see…But how did she undo that charm on the keys anyway?
Bouhroum said it was a powerful bit of magic, and only the person
who placed it could undo it,” wondered Asuna.
Her answer came from Myia, who took off her gas mask at last to
drink some water. Once she was done and put the cap on the
canteen again, the girl said, “It looked to me like she simply crushed
the charm out of existence with sheer strength alone.”
“B-but if that’s true…this is just getting ridiculous,” I said, then
suddenly hunched my neck and realized I owed the girl an apology.
“Oh, right…I guess that wasn’t very nice of me. I gave away the key
your mother kept safe for so long, just to save some people I know…”
“If you hadn’t done that, I’m certain she would have killed me, too,”
she replied with a calmness beyond her years, only to then pull the
gas mask back over her little face. With her voice a bit muffled now,
she continued, “Plus, based on the way she spoke, I think what she
really wanted was the first thing, the…sacred keys? The keys she got
from you and me were more incidental, it seemed. Maybe someone
just asked her for them.”
“Oh, I got that feeling, too…” said Asuna. She rested her hands on
Myia’s thin shoulders from behind.
I frowned, wondering who might have asked for such a thing. But
before I could come up with any potential answers, the incoming
instant message icon popped up. It was from Argo. And it read…
245|P

DKB AND ALS JUST FOUGHT CENTIPEDE BOSS IN SOUTH AREA. IT
WAS A TOUGH FIGHT UNTIL AN NPC WOMAN RUSHED IN AND BEAT
THE BOSS. SHE HAD A GOLDEN BOX IN HER LEFT HAND, AND WHEN
SHE RAISED IT UP, THE CENTIPEDE’S ARMOR TURNED INTO LITTLE
BLOCKS AND CRUMBLED APART. LIN-KIBA HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT
MEANS, EITHER. INFORMATION WANTED.
“………Huh?”
Kizmel and Myia glanced over at me, wondering what I was yelping
about.
“Oh, er, it’s just…I got some weird information from an instant…er,
my Art of Far Scribing…”
“You did? From whom?” wondered Asuna, who left Myia’s side and
came over to see. I switched the window to make it visible to party
members and pondered what this meant.
A “golden box” might possibly be the golden cube that had been
removed from the lord’s mansion in Stachion. Would that make the
NPC who barged into the fight Myia’s mother, Theano? What did it
mean that she held up the cube, and the centipede’s armor
crumbled? The golden cube was just supposed to be a quest item
that signified the master of the town and not have any intrinsic
power of its own. Plus, what was Argo doing with this Lin-Kiba
business? If Lind and Kibaou found out about that, they’d be
furious…
At that point, having lost my train of thought down a side alley, I
glanced over at Asuna. My partner lifted her head, and we shared a
look for a couple seconds before nodding together.
As I closed my window, Asuna turned to Myia and said, “You know…I
think we might have found Theano.”
“What…?!” The girl’s back went straight as an arrow, and she took a
step toward Asuna. “Wh-where…? Where is my mother?!”
246|P

“Well…supposedly she was seen in the caves in the southern area…”
“Southern…area?” the girl asked, confusion radiating through her
mask. Only then did I recall that the girl had never been out of
Stachion. Asuna crouched down and drew a simple map in the sand.
“See, this is how the sixth floor, which is where we are, is split into
five areas…There’s a star-shaped lake in the middle, and the south
area, or fourth area, is right here. We’re in the northwest area, so it’s
all the way on the other side…”
“But…that’s so far away. What is my mother doing there…?” Myia
mourned. In fact, the straight-line distance from Castle Galey to the
Cave City of Goskai in the south area was only a little over five
kilometers. In the real world, that would be the distance from the
center of Kawagoe City to the center of neighboring Sayama—but I
didn’t think Myia or even Asuna would understand what I meant by
that.
To the people who essentially spent their entire lives where they
were programmed to stay, however, the place on the other side of
the map might as well be another country. In fact, the first time I left
the Town of Beginnings, the labyrinth tower felt like it was across the
entire world from me.
“…I don’t know what Theano’s ultimate purpose is,” I said, “but
based on her actions, it seems like she’s trying to take the golden
cube she removed from the mansion to some other place.”
Asuna nodded. “I agree…and I doubt the south area is her
destination.”
“It is probably the Pillar of the Heavens,” said Kizmel, her first words
in quite some time. The other three of us focused on her.
“Do you know something, Kizmel?”

247|P

“Not specifically…When I visited Stachion with you, a memory came
to my mind. Though I have not seen it myself, I understand that the
Pillar of the Heavens on this floor is built of those same stacked
cubes of rock.”
“Oh, that reminds me,” I nearly said out loud, only stopping myself at
the last moment. In the beta, I’d gone up the labyrinth tower of the
sixth floor, of course, but I couldn’t explain that to Kizmel and Myia. I
did recall the tower’s exterior incorporating blocks that were similar
to Stachion’s.
“Which means…we should probably hurry. I don’t know what Theano
means to do at the tower, but there will be a fearsome guardian
beast there,” Asuna noted, throwing me a knowing glance.
I nodded. “Yeah…good idea. But…hang on, let me check something.”
My window was still open, so I typed a response at the speed of light
to Argo, feeling Myia’s fascinated gaze on my skin the whole time. It
occurred to me only just then that human NPCs couldn’t use an
inventory or menu window, either, but obviously, I couldn’t explain
that to her.
The info broker was waiting for my response and had a new message
for me in less than a minute.
NPC RAN NORTHEAST THROUGH THE CAVE WITHOUT A WORD
AFTER BOSS DIED. LIN-KIBA EACH SUSPECT SHE WAS AN NPC FROM
THE OTHER’S QUEST. ONCE FR REFUEL IN GOSKAI, THEY’LL
PROBABLY HEAD STRAIGHT TO FIFTH AREA.
That one sent me grumbling. On the third and fifth floors, the PK
agitators had set Lind’s DKB and Kibaou’s ALS against each other, but
this time, the one making them paranoid about each other was
Theano—a person from my quest. We couldn’t let the matter go
unaddressed, both to set Myia at ease and to ensure there wasn’t
needless discord between the two big guilds.
248|P

I let Argo know I’d tell her more in person and closed my window.
After another bit of eye contact with Asuna, I crouched down to
speak to Myia.
“It sounds like your mother is heading for the fifth area, after all.
We’re going to rush after her, but…”
I wanted to tell her that she should go back to Stachion and wait, but
Myia exhibited an extremely curious reaction for an NPC: She cut me
off.
“No, I want to go with you. If my mother is doing something
dangerous, I cannot simply stay at home and wait.”
The girl had already lost her father. If she was this insistent, I really
couldn’t stop her. Not to mention that Myia was a higher level than
me or Asuna.
“…All right,” I said, straightening up again.
“I would like to as well,” said Kizmel with a crestfallen tone, “but I
must report to the storyteller and castle lord that I allowed the fallen
elves to steal the four sacred keys. My sword is damaged, too…”
“But…aren’t they going to blame you for that, Kizmel? It was our
fault that the keys were stolen, so we should be the ones to go…”
Asuna said, looking nervous.
“Yeah,” I piped up. “I’ll go and make a proper apology to old
Bouhroum and Count Galeyon…”
But the knight just smiled. “Do not worry. I am one of the queen’s
own Pagoda Royal Knights. Only Her Majesty and the knight
commander have the right to formally rebuke me. The priests might
complain, but the simple truth of the matter is that I could not match
Kysarah the Ransacker…I shall have to focus myself anew and regain
the keys myself.”

249|P

“…Oh…But when you do, we’re going to be fighting at your side,”
Asuna proclaimed, grabbing Kizmel’s right hand with both of hers
and squeezing. I walked up to the knight and shared a firm
handshake with her.
“Kizmel, tell old man Bouhroum that I’m going to go back and
apologize to him. And if you want, until your sword gets fixed, take
this…You might not like it, since it’s an enemy blade, but…”
I had pulled out a weapon from my inventory for this purpose: the
Elven Stout Sword I received from fighting the forest elf captain on
the fourth floor. Even in its base, non-upgraded state, it was nearly
as strong as my old Anneal Blade +8.
“Ooooh…” Kizmel murmured as she took it and pulled the mirrorlike
blade out of the silver-decorated sheath.
Unfortunately, I immediately regretted my action. Kizmel’s long
saber was in the Curved Blade category, and the Stout Sword was
under the one-handed sword skill. Using a weapon with a skill you
hadn’t learned meant you couldn’t make use of its stats, nor any of
its sword skills, of course.
But Kizmel just smiled, slid the sword back into the sheath, and said,
“It is a good sword, and I will gladly use it. The forest elves may be
our longtime foes, but their blacksmiths’ work is undeniable…And
also…”
For a moment, it seemed like she was going to say something more,
but the knight just shook her head and hung the Stout Sword from
her side instead of the cracked saber. She put that weapon over her
back, then reached into her pouch.
“It is not much of a trade, but you may have this from me.”
She handed me a small bottle that was carved like a crystal. It was
only the size of a thumb, but I knew it contained something

250|P

unfathomably valuable, and so I stared her straight in the face.
“Are…are you sure? Isn’t this a great dark elf treasure…?”
“If not for you and Asuna and Myia, the Fallen would control Castle
Galey at this moment, and all the contents of the treasure chamber
would be lost. In that sense, this is a meager reward…and with it, you
can cross the lake directly rather than taking the long left path,
correct?”
She was right, of course. Going the normal route from the second
area to the labyrinth tower in the fifth area would take nearly an
entire day, even avoiding combat with monsters. In order to catch up
to Theano, who was already in the fourth area, the Drops of Villi in
this bottle were not just useful, they were vital.
“…Thanks. This will really help us,” I said, accepting the gift.
Kizmel stepped back and looked at Asuna and Myia. “I suspect that
once I finish reporting to the lord of the castle…I will be moving to
the seventh floor. We shall part ways for a time, but I believe I will
see you again soon enough.”
“Yes, of course!” Asuna said, embracing Kizmel. Myia reached up a
small hand for a shake. The four of us walked to the exit of the deadend canyon and went our separate ways, waving all the while.
Several times after we started walking south, I turned around to look
and saw that Kizmel’s back was hidden against the reddish cliffs as
she returned to Castle Galey. Within a minute, the knight’s HP bar
silently vanished from the upper-left corner of my view.

251|P

WE GOT THROUGH THE DRY CANYON WITH A MINIMUM of battle
and crossed the wasteland without being tempted by any sudden
cactus fruiting, eventually reaching the bank of Lake Talpha before it
got dark.
It was after five thirty in the afternoon, and the navy-blue lake shone
and flickered with the light of the flame-like setting sun. Myia stood
at the edge of the water, lifted her gas mask up, and exclaimed in
wonder:
“Wow…I’ve never seen so much water in my life. Is this the
ocean…?”
Asuna stood behind Myia—she seemed to like that position—and
held her shoulders as she said, “This is Talpha…It’s a lake, Myia. An
ocean is much, much bigger…hundreds and thousands of times
bigger than this.”
“Thousands of times…? Bigger than this entire floor of the castle…?”
“Yeah, that’s right…The real ocean is something you can only see
down on the earth that’s far below Aincrad, I suppose…”
As they chatted, I popped open the bottle Kizmel gave me, lifted my
foot behind me rather than in front this time, and carefully dripped it
onto the soles of my boots. Once the buff was active, I approached
the girls and performed the same process. The level of the bottle was
much lower than the first time I saw it used, but it looked like we still
had a few doses left.
I put the little bottle back in my inventory and carefully stepped into
the water. After a few strides, I felt the familiar pushback on my
soles, and the surface of the lake began to behave like a layer of
rubber.

252|P

Behind me, Asuna and Myia were slowly following, holding hands.
We had to explain the threat of the giant starfish Ophiometus that
lurked in the depths of the lake, so there was definitely an element
of fear in Myia’s uncertain steps. But because she was so small and
light, I figured she was in less danger of breaking through the surface
by stepping roughly. Asuna and I were about the same height, and I
couldn’t be sure which of us had heavier equipment, but that sort of
thing was hard to ask a person about.
The topic of personal questions reminded me that I still hadn’t asked
her about the mystery of the two-handed lance skill. This seemed
like a good opportunity to chat, since there wasn’t anything else to
do but walk, but the memory of Asuna charging with that lance was
so shocking and vivid, I was finding it difficult to broach the topic. I
silently promised myself Next time and focused on the sensations in
my feet instead.
When going to the fourth area to retrieve the hidden key, we went
almost directly south, but going to the fifth area meant cutting
across the lake to the southeast. The far bank was shrouded in fog
and hard to see, so I made sure my map was open as we walked. It
wasn’t much more than a kilometer, but being forced into a slow
sneaking walk meant it took time. The reddish light of the sunset on
the base of the floor above us passed with shocking speed, and darkblue dusk soon followed.
Suddenly, the winds blowing across the lake grew colder, and I
hunched my shoulders. The chill rising from my feet began to tickle
the back of my nose. Then another chill, something entirely
unrelated to the cold, assaulted my body.
Oh no.
I need to sneeze.
I came to a stop, covering my mouth in an attempt to make the
itchiness subside, but it was only getting stronger. My lungs filled on
253|P

their own as I sucked in mouthfuls of air. I couldn’t take it. I couldn’t
resist.
“…Ehh-shoo!”
Having my mouth covered killed some of the sound, but I couldn’t
stop my body from jerking. My weight pressing against the water
broke the heightened surface tension, and my right foot loudly
plunked through the top of the lake. Naturally, I tried to force my left
foot down stronger to push myself up, but that, too, sank. But right
before I was sure I would topple fully into the water, I felt my
outstretched arms pulled on either side. I looked up to see Asuna
with my right hand and Myia with my left, the two trying to hold me
up.
“Slowly! Slowly pull your feet up!” Asuna ordered. I relaxed my
muscles as best I could, balancing my weight evenly between my left
foot and my hands, then carefully extracted my right foot from the
water, resting it on the surface again and exhaling.
“Th-thanks, you saved…”
But before I could fully thank her, Asuna thrust out her hand.
“Shh! Do you hear that…?”
I clamped my mouth shut and focused my attention—on what felt
like a deep bubbling sound rumbling up from the center of the lake. I
looked over, terrified at what I would find, and saw large bubbles
rising and popping here and there over the water.
“What…? Just from that…?” I groaned. All I did was break through
the surface for a second!
But the bubbles didn’t stop. The water wasn’t translucent with the
setting sun shining off it, but I could sense something unfathomably
huge rising up from the bottom of the lake.

254|P

Eventually, about thirty meters away, three cursors appeared on the
surface in a row. The name displayed on all of them was TENTACLE
OF OPHIOMETUS. Their color was a deep red, if not as dark as
Kysarah’s. They were located approximately in the center of our
route, and whether we turned back or pushed on, there would be no
escape at our walking speed across the water.
I was almost about to get desperate and suggest letting the tentacles
grab us so they would drag us down to the starfish’s mouth where
we might stand a chance at a last counterattack—when Asuna
shouted, “Kirito, Myia, let’s run!”
“B-but if we run, won’t it break the effect of the Drops of Villi…?” I
stammered.
“Shorten your strides and put out your left foot before the right
starts sinking! With the buff the drops confer, you should be able to
pull it off!”
It sounded like something a ninja would do, but before I could
complain, she was pushing me onward. I had to stick out my right
foot before I toppled over, and although it felt like I was going to
break through again, I made sure not to try pulling back but quickly
took a step with my left foot before the resistance completely broke.
Then my right foot, then left, right, left…My first few steps were
awkward, but once I got the idea of quick steps at high speed, I soon
realized that I was running across the water.
“Whoa…this actually works,” I murmured, trotting quickly. Soon Myia
passed me on the left side. She almost seemed to be having fun,
making crisp little spak-spak-spak-spak sounds as she went, probably
because she got better resistance being lighter. On my right, Asuna
followed with a smooth, gliding run. She seemed very practiced at
this somehow—and then I recalled something she had said
yesterday: “If the starfish does show up, I have an ace up my pant
leg.”
255|P

She was probably referring to this running technique, but the only
reason I was able to just barely pull it off at my first attempt was
because of the protection of the Droplets of Villi. I could easily
imagine myself sinking before my third step without the buff. The
same would be true for Asuna, so how did she come up with this
ninja-like technique?
These thoughts only used a tenth of my brain, though. Six parts went
to the control of my legs, and the remaining three were focused on
the watery sounds behind us. I couldn’t stop to ascertain the nature
of the splashing, but it was very easy to imagine those starfish
tentacles breaching the surface and chasing after us. I got the feeling
that they were drawing closer, but we didn’t have any other recourse
than to keep running as fast as we could.
After one, two, then three bands of mist hovering over the lake, the
beach of the far bank, orange in the sunset, came into view. It looked
to be about a hundred meters to the part of the land that jutted
farthest into the lake.
“Nrraaaaah!” I bellowed, shuffling along the top of the water as close
to the red zone as I could manage. Normally, I ran with long, leaping
strides, so this kind of running was hellishly alien to me, but if I took
steps any longer than this, I wouldn’t be able to safely pull them back
above the water in time.
I bet that Argo would be good at this sort of thing. Maybe I should
bump up my AGI a bit, too, I thought as I sped across the remaining
distance and reached the bank two seconds behind Myia. I kept my
scampering speed even after it was sand beneath my boots and
waddled onward as I slowed my pace.
Only when the ground underfoot turned from beach sand to grass
did I finally come to a stop, panting. When I turned around, there
were three red cursors floating about ten meters onto land past the
water’s edge. Writhing like snakes beneath the cursors were dark256|P

gray tentacles. Their ends were extremely sharp, but they widened
to about a third of a meter across where they went back into the
water. How wide they were at the base, and the total span of the
body, were too frightening to consider, and I had no interest in
finding out.
The tentacles waved through empty air for ten seconds, frustrated,
before giving up and slithering back into the water. The cursors
trailed away into the body of the lake and vanished, at which point I
finally let out the breath I’d been holding.
At my sides, Myia and Asuna were staring at the water in silence. The
beach faced west, so the sun shining through the aperture at the far
side of the floor blazed red against the surface of the lake. It was a
beautiful sight, even when you considered that there was a
monstrous giant starfish lurking just underneath it.
As I gazed upon the sunset of January 4, I suddenly felt a powerful
fatigue.
After all, I’d started at two AM, gotten up to explore the outer rim of
Castle Galey, gained the Awakening skill while being taunted by
Bouhroum’s steak, then gone to Stachion in the morning, met Myia,
gotten attacked by fallen elves, returned to the castle in the
afternoon, started to nap but was awakened by a major Fallen
invasion, fought that off, then went out to rescue the Qusack
hostages, lost our sacred keys and iron keys to Kysarah, split off from
Kizmel with barely a moment to reflect on it, crossed Lake Talpha,
ran away from a giant starfish, and here we were. That might be a
record for the most I’d ever experienced in a single day since the
game’s official launch.
My batteries were pretty much drained, and I was more than ready
to eat my fill at a fancier-than-usual inn and dive into bed, but that
wasn’t in the cards. If Myia’s mother, Theano, was heading for the
labyrinth tower, our only chance to catch her was while she was
257|P

moving across the map. If she entered the intricate dungeon inside
the tower, it would be very hard to find her.
“…Ready for just a bit more?” I asked the two girls. Asuna and Myia
spun to face me.
“Of course. I’m perfectly ready,” said Asuna.
“I’m good, too,” said Myia in her gas mask. “I can still go.”
That ruled out any possibility that I could plead for a break. “Then
let’s head for the nearest town. This area’s basically just a straight
shot down the road, so that’s what Theano and the front-running
group will travel down.”
When I turned my back on the lake, I was faced with a new sea: one
of sand.
The five distinct areas of the sixth floor, separated by tall, jutting rock
formations, were each wildly different. The first (northeast) area,
which contained the main town of the floor, featured forests and
fields. The second (northwest) area, which contained Castle Galey,
was a rocky, arid wasteland. The third (southwest) area, which we
skipped, was swampland. The fourth (south) area, with the dungeon
containing the elves’ sacred key, was themed after caves, and the
fifth (southeast) area, where we stood now, was desert.
It was a classic RPG terrain theme, but facing a real desert in a
VRMMO presentation, I was stunned at the overwhelming scale of it.
Massive sand dunes stretched as far as the eye could see, and there
were no landmarks to define the distance. There were even heat
mirages that served as visual traps, appearing like an oasis but
vanishing just before you reached it. On top of all that, the far
distance was blurred out by a wind-and-dust effect that meant we
couldn’t even see the labyrinth tower until we were within a
hundred meters of it.

258|P

Worst of all, the handy map screen on my window was given the
same treatment as the Forest of Wavering Mists on the third floor,
graying out sections at random. The only thing you could trust was
the narrow redbrick road that ran through the desert, visible only at
certain sections.
Even the little bit of grass we were standing on faded out within ten
or fifteen meters, transitioning into sand that was of a different
texture than the stuff at the lakeside. A lonely trail that looked ready
to fade away in the wind stretched onward.
“…And we just follow that path?” Asuna asked.
I nodded. “Yep, that should lead us to the final resting point of this
floor, the village of Murutsuki.”
“Any bosses out there?”
“If you’re coming from the fourth area, there’s a carnivorous plant–
type boss right before Murutsuki, but from our direction, it should be
all clear.”
“I’m hearing a lot of shoulds,” she noted drily, which elicited a giggle
from Myia.
“Kirito, have you been to this desert before?”
“Yeah…” I said automatically, before reconsidering and holding
myself to the bare minimum of an answer, lest I start telling Myia
about the beta test. “Just once before, a long time ago. I…should
remember where the village was, at least.”
“Then let’s go and leave a trail of breadcrumbs, in case we get lost,”
the girl said, presumably joking—until I realized she wasn’t. It made
me wonder if Theano had read her fairy tales like that one.
“Hmm. Well, I think in a desert, the wind would blow the bread
crumbs away. As long as we don’t lose sight of the brick road, we
should be fine. And if we get lost, we can always come back here.”
259|P

“Then I’ll make sure we’re always on the path!” Myia said, starting to
walk and forcing Asuna and me to catch up. My partner leaned over
to me and whispered, “You seem to be surprisingly adept at dealing
with little girls.”
“Wh-what…? I’m ultra-bad at it! Just as bad as girls my age and older
girls, too.”
“…Uh-huh,” said the fencer, pulling away with a look that might have
been exasperation or possibly pity.
After just five minutes of walking in the desert, Lake Talpha was out
of sight behind the huge sand dunes. All that I saw over my shoulder
was faded-purple sky and dark-red sun, and ahead of us and to the
sides, everything was shrouded in a sandy haze, with even the pillars
of the outer perimeter hidden from sight. I could make out the rocky
floor above us, but the details were fuzzy.
Even our trusty brick road was covered by sand or crumbled away in
parts. Now and then, desert monsters like lizards and snakes
attacked from the nearby sands. If you had to look for a positive
feature, at least this place was without the “blessing of the green,”
like the wasteland area, so there shouldn’t be any danger of a fallen
elf attack…except for those darn branches they had. Then again,
after Kysarah took the iron keys away from us, maybe we didn’t need
to worry about them bothering us anymore.
Still, I kept my guard up as we walked. After about thirty minutes
with Myia in the lead, we arrived at Murutsuki just as the last rays of
light vanished behind us.
It wasn’t a big place at all, but it did have a large oasis spring in the
center of town, with palm trees and cycads spreading their long,
narrow leaves along the edge of the clear, crisp water. The buildings
were made of sand-colored stone with the same rough texture as
Castle Galey, but without any kind of ornamentation whatsoever.

260|P

The short main street was lit with simple fires, and there were sad,
lonely strings playing from somewhere.
“This kind of Arabian-sounding instrument…” I whispered to my
partner. “I remember wanting to look up what it’s called back in the
beta.”
Asuna inclined her head briefly. “I’m pretty sure it’s…an oud.”
“Oh…well,” I said, impressed at her worldly knowledge. I lowered my
voice further. “If I don’t forget by the time we beat this game, I’ll
have to look that up when we get back.”
“Since you’re here, why don’t you try practicing with it?”
“I, uh, I don’t think the Musical Instrument skill is going to be of
much use here…” I said, shaking my head. This actually seemed like
the perfect time to bring up the two-handed lance skill, but before I
could broach the topic, Myia turned back from up ahead and called
out to us.
“There’s a…very strange horse over there!”
She was pointing at one of the palm trees on the north end of the
spring, where a large four-legged creature with brown shaggy fur
was tied up. I recognized its distinctive back and curved neck from
the real world—pictures and videos, if not personal experience.
“That’s not a horse, Myia. It’s a camel,” said Asuna, walking up to the
girl and pointing at the animal’s back. “See those big humps on its
back? If it has one, it’s called a dromedary. If it has two, it’s a camel.”
“But that camel has more than that.”
“Huh?”
Asuna and I looked closer and saw that the camel indeed had three
humps on its back. It wasn’t a shock to me, because I’d seen it in the
beta. But Asuna just paused, and a bit awkwardly, she said,
“That’s…called a three-humped camel…”
261|P

“Frmphs!” went the sound that escaped my throat. Asuna shot me a
nasty glare, then trotted off with Myia to get a closer look.
Upon closer examination, while the center area of Murutsuki was
smaller than the courtyard of Castle Galey, they were similar in
layout. In the center was the natural spring, about twenty-five
meters across, with palm trees lining the edge. Along the outer edge
of the doughnut-shaped plaza were shops, inns, and restaurants.
Theano would surely pass through this plaza on her way to the
labyrinth tower, so as long as we took a seat on an open terrace
along the north side, where the path began again, we wouldn’t miss
her. The oud-playing NPC was on the south side of the spring, so I
couldn’t see them, but the distance made for just the right volume
for dinner background music.
As I pondered what to eat, I gazed out at the row of buildings. The
restaurants I could see—really more like fancy food carts—were only
two. One was kebab-like roasted meat, while the other served a soup
that resembled curry. There were few restaurants that served curry
in the game, so in the beta, more than a few players made the trek
from Stachion to distant Murutsuki, but I found it a bit
underwhelming. For one thing, there was no rice on the menu. The
Arab-style curry with Aincrad’s traditional flatbread was fine, but as a
growing teenage boy, I just wanted a huge dollop on top of a
steaming mound of white rice. So tonight it would be kebabs.
“Hey, I’m gonna order some food now,” I called out to the camel
watchers.
“Okay,” they said, waving. That meant I was in charge of the order. I
turned away, determined to put every meat dish on the table. No
space to waste on measly salads or steamed vegetables!
I had gone about three steps, clutching my empty belly, when a short
player came tearing across the open area from the south and darted

262|P

to the counter of the kebab shop. Once I saw the green cursor, I
hurried to stand next to them.
“Hey, pal, I’ll take a shish kebab and an Adana kebab!”
“Hey, mister, I want three doner sandwiches, three urfa kebabs,
and…” I shouted, jostling for space—until I recognized the unique
sound of the other customer’s voice. The high-pitched, coquettish
voice and rising nasal inflection…
“A-Argo?!”
“Oh, it’s you, Kii-boy,” said Argo the Rat, whisker-painted cheeks
breaking into a grin when she saw me. “Ah, yer already at Murutsuki,
huh? That was quick.”
“Y-you’re gonna talk to me about being quick?! I thought it was
gonna take five hours to get through the cave of the fourth area…”
The bearded cook shouted “Food’s up!” and we received our dishes
in short order. Argo could carry her two skewers in her hands, but I
had three round sandwiches of seared meat and three skewers on
the counter, so it required some cradling and delicate pinching
between fingers to get them all.
“H-hey…you wanna sit down at that table over there?” I suggested,
glancing at one of the open-seating spots in front of the business.
But the info dealer scowled and shook her head.
“I don’t think we’ve got the time.”
“Huh…? Why?”
“Because if I’m here, that means…”
At last, I picked up on her implication. If Argo had just arrived at
Murutsuki during her chase of Theano, that meant…
“Ugh…so Theano—that’s the NPC with the golden cube—already
passed through this village…?!”
263|P

“I checked with the guide NPC at the entrance, and they said a
woman went through here on her own about thirty minutes ago.”
“…Thirty minutes…” I repeated, pulling up a mental map of the fifth
area.
Murutsuki was in the center of the fan-shaped area. The labyrinth
tower in the northeast corner was about a kilometer away. But going
along the twisting path made the journey over twice as long. If we
walked quickly, it was still less than two hours—and even shorter at
a run. We should assume that Theano had a healthy head start on us.
“…Where are the ALS and DKB?”
“They should be on their way, but they said they were gonna stop in
Goskai and resupply first…I’d bet they’re about thirty minutes
behind.”
“Hrmm…”
Somehow, I had to think through the delicious smell of the doner
kebabs cradled in my left arm and the even-better-smelling urfa
kebabs in my right.
The reason for Theano’s actions was still unclear. But if she was
heading for the labyrinth tower, it was quite possible that her final
destination was the boss chamber. If Asuna, Myia, Argo, and I chased
after Theano and had to fight the boss by ourselves, it would be
nearly impossible to win. We would all die. The right decision was to
wait for the big group to arrive in Murutsuki.
…But.
Now the “Curse of Stachion” quest was completely off the original
rails. Theano was most likely acting on what you might consider her
own will. She was going to end up choosing some action that
ultimately cost her her life. It would mean the loss of both parents
for Myia, who trusted us enough to follow us around.

264|P

In no more than three seconds, I had made up my mind. I ushered
Argo away from the kebab shop. At the north end of the oasis area,
the two girls were petting the three-humped camel. I called out,
“Hey! We’re heading out soon!”
Asuna wasn’t happy about the idea of eating as we walked—make
that trotted—but only until she heard what Argo had to report. As
soon as she knew Theano was still ahead of us, she eliminated the
food in her hands as quickly—and gracefully—as possible.
“You said she passed through the village thirty minutes ahead of us,
but what about the field boss?” she asked the info dealer. “Theano
might be tough, but that’s a monster that you can’t beat on your
own, surely.”
“That’s true…but lookit this,” said Argo, who had finished her two
kebabs as fast as me. She went to her window and pulled out an oddlooking thing. It was a greenish-brown object about twenty
centimeters across in all directions.
“There were tons of these scattered across the ground by the time I
showed up to the field boss’s lair.”
“What is that…?” I asked. Argo tossed it to me without warning. I
caught it, alarmed, and was stunned again when I got a good look at
it. It felt like balsa wood, and there was a fine fibrous pattern on its
surface.
“Wait, is this…the carnivorous plant’s body?”
“Prob’ly. When she charged into the fight against the centipede boss
in the fourth area, that Theano lady broke down its armor into cubes
the same size. It was only the armor, not what was underneath, but
its defense plummeted, so the FRs beat it easy with an all-out attack.
The centipede—it was called Basalt Morpha—didn’t have normal
plates of armor but damn tough rock. Maybe that cube Theano had
can break down any kind of mineral or plant…?”
265|P

True to her reputation, the info dealer’s conjecture seemed very
accurate. In my head, I was looking at distant Stachion, the main
town of the floor.
Every building in that place was built with blocks of rock or wood. To
this point, I just assumed the golden cube, sign of the town lord, was
merely the standard to which all the construction blocks were made.
In fact, that was how it was explained in the beta. But maybe that
wasn’t actually the case. Maybe, like Argo said, the cube had the
power to turn all minerals and plants into blocks, and it was
responsible for the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of blocks in
Stachion…
“Hey, Asuna, how many blocks do you think there are total making
up all of Stachion?” I asked, pausing my thought process.
The fencer frowned and said, “Is that something we need to know
right now?”
“I…I think so.”
“Well…to break it down exactly, the town was two thousand feet
from north to south, and one thousand feet from east to west. So
divide twenty-four thousand by eight to get three thousand, then
multiply by fifteen hundred for a total of four and a half million.”
“Uh…thanks…”
Asuna then jabbed my arm, and Argo snorted with annoyance on the
other side of me. Up ahead, Myia nimbly turned around while
running with a half-eaten sandwich and skewer in her hands. “Kirito,
that is only the number of stones forming the ground. But the
buildings rise up above the ground, so…”
“Oh, r-right. Um…” I stammered, starting to envision all of Stachion.

266|P

Asuna got the point quicker. “Look, why don’t we just estimate that
it’s three times the base total? So that would be somewhere around
thirteen and a half million blocks.”
“Ooh, thanks a million,” I said, but Asuna didn’t seem satisfied yet.
“So what do you need that number for?” she pressed.
“Oh…I was just thinking, what if the wood and stone blocks that
make up Stachion weren’t cut individually with saws and chisels, but
they were broken down from nearby mountains and forests with the
power of that golden cube…?”
“Ah, I see…Well, I just came here after witnessin’ a whole pile of
blocks dropped by the carnivorous plant boss, so yer crazy idea’s got
some real legs to it.” Argo grinned. But just as quickly, she looked
pensive.
We’d long ago left Murutsuki behind and were back on the desert
path. The sun had set entirely by now, and though the desert dust
clouds blocked the moonlight, there was fortunately a pale-blue
environmental light that glowed against the slopes of the dunes. At
this rate, we could have rented some camels in Murutsuki and
enjoyed a nighttime trek through the desert…if only we had the time,
and if only I knew where exactly on a three-humped camel to sit.
In the chilly night air, Argo’s voice was more serious than earlier.
“You know…if that’s true, we might have some trouble on our
hands.”
“What do you mean?”
“If she can break down all kinds of rock and wood, couldn’t she jus’
bust through all the walls of the dungeon? Make a straight run all the
way ta the boss, forget all the traps an’ tricks. The ALS and DKB
probably think it was Theano’s power that broke up the centipede’s
armor. But if they find out it was the cube that did it, they’ll be on
the hunt for it.”
267|P

“Oh…good point…”
A little imagination pointed out that the golden cube’s uses went far
beyond dungeon shortcuts. Aincrad was full of plant monsters like
treants and nepenthes, and stone-based monsters like golems and
gargoyles, which could theoretically be dissolved into blocks in an
instant. If you could get experience points for that? You’d be able to
level at incredible speed. The guild flag in my inventory had nothing
on this cube when it came to potential game-breaking effects.
If the “Curse of Stachion” questline proceeded ordinarily, Cylon
would have survived and reformed, the cube would be buried in
Pithagrus’s grave again, and the player would never know its true
power, much less actually possess it. But the night that Morte and
the dagger wielder killed Cylon, the quest began to shift dramatically.
I had a feeling that we could seize the cube if Theano were killed,
too…
“…I think that Argo is correct,” said Myia, who had finished her food
and put the gas mask back on. Argo, who thought of her as a simple
quest NPC, blinked in mild surprise.
The girl continued in a very natural manner, “My mother told me
once that Stachion is a town ‘built of magic and curse.’ She didn’t tell
me what that meant when I asked…but perhaps it was because she
knew that the golden cube had a terrible power within it.”
“Y-you mean Theano is heading for the Pillar of the Heavens to do
something with the cube’s power?” I prompted.
“We don’t know that yet,” answered Asuna. “Maybe she’s just trying
to do something to the cube…But for now, we just need to catch up
to her.”
“Yep, that sounds right,” agreed Argo, who looked forward. Like
always, the narrow path wove through the sand dunes, but I could

268|P

sense that a huge structure was approaching through the deep-blue
darkness somewhere ahead.
“…Let’s hurry,” Asuna said, and we picked up our speed once more.
It was worth putting in the effort not to stray off the brick path, as
we only ran into monsters a total of four times, but we did not spot
Theano while in the desert.
If she wasn’t acting in accordance with a script, the monsters should
attack her, too, and lizards and snakes weren’t trees or rocks, so the
cube couldn’t deconstruct them. On top of that, this being the last
area on the sixth floor, all the monsters were tough. If she could beat
them all herself, Theano would be on Kizmel’s level—at the very
least, far tougher than Cylon, whom Morte easily killed.
With Myia present, all I could do was pray that no matter how things
shook out, we wouldn’t have to fight Theano.
There was an especially large dune ahead that we raced up, with
Asuna and Myia reaching the peak a few seconds before me. There,
they came to a stop and stared upward.
When I crested the hill, I saw it too: Just a hundred meters away, a
mammoth structure stood darker than the night. It was the labyrinth
tower of the sixth floor. Four days after we started this floor on
January 1, we had finally reached it.
The normal plan, prioritizing safety, would call for the full help of the
front-line group in mapping out the interior of the tower, taking a
day or two to discover the boss chamber, another day to scout out
and strategize against that boss, and one more day for the battle
itself. But in this case (as in others before), we couldn’t sit back and
take our time. Like the fifth floor, where we needed to complete the
tower and beat the boss in a single day, this was one where we’d
need to rush through it, careful mapping be damned.

269|P

“…We didn’t catch up to Theano after all, and the ALS and DKB didn’t
catch up to us…” I murmured, looking over my shoulder from the top
of the dune.
“The tower is one thing, but I don’t know if I like us heading to the
boss chamber with a group this small,” Asuna said, her tone worried.
“Let’s just hope that’s not where Theano’s going.”
“Yeah…but there’s usually not much else to do in a labyrinth…”
“Then we just gotta catch up before the boss chamber,” said Argo. I
turned back, and she tossed long, thin bottles to both Asuna and me.
I caught mine, popped the lid off, and put it to my lips. Chilled lime
flavor with a hint of carbonation refreshed my tongue. It didn’t seem
to be a type of potion, but it tasted great after a run across the dry,
dusty desert. Myia was drinking one, too, holding it with both hands.
Refreshed by Argo’s gifts, we rushed down the last sand dune toward
the tower. The layout of the sixth-floor tower was not circular, or
square, but pentagonal. It was so huge, however, that it was difficult
to tell just from looking up at it; I recalled only figuring it out in the
beta once I went inside to map it. At the time, there was debate
among the testers as to whether or not the five-sided shape meant
something, but we never arrived at a satisfactory consensus.
The blackish stone walls of the tower, once seen up close, were
indeed run through with lines every twenty centimeters, like the
buildings in Stachion. The huge doors at the front of the ground floor
were closed tight, and there didn’t seem to be another soul around.
We were only assuming that Theano was coming here, so there was
always the possibility that we were completely off the mark, but I
had to trust my gut on this one.
“…Let’s open it up.”

270|P

With that warning, I placed my hands on the bronze doors and
pushed hard. They rumbled heavily as they parted to the side, and a
gust of cold air rushed out of the structure past me.
Once the doors were completely open, I beckoned the other three
into the tower. Like the other towers, it wasn’t completely darkened;
pale-blue lights high above cast down a faint glow to see by. If the
layout was the same as in the beta, there would be a large triangular
hall beyond the entrance, with one door on each side wall…
“Oh, look up there!” said Myia, who apparently had better eyesight
than the three players she accompanied. She was pointing ahead and
to the left. When I saw it, I gasped awkwardly, “Uwha…”
The metal door was in the place I remembered, but there was now a
huge hole in the stone wall just to the right of it. It wasn’t split or
smashed open; it looked like the cohesive force of the blocks that
made up the tower had been lost, causing them to collapse.
I walked up to the hole, lifted one of the stone blocks, and said,
“So…Theano used the golden cube to break down the wall…I
suppose.”
“But why didn’t she go through the door…?” Asuna asked. “Is it
locked?”
I glanced farther into the room and said, “See how there are stone
pillars growing up from the floor there? You’re supposed to solve the
puzzles on the pillars, then beat the monsters that appear…I’m
pretty sure,” I said, trying my best not to be too suspicious with
information around Myia.
The fencer seemed satisfied and nodded. “Ah, so she just cut out
that step. Then if we follow the path she’s taken, we won’t have to
do the puzzles, either…”
“Probably not. But we’ll still have normal wimpy monsters to deal
with,” I said, tossing the stone block aside. Just then, as if drawn by
271|P

the sound of the stone—in fact, it almost certainly was—there was a
hissing roar from beyond the hole.
“Here it comes!”
I drew my sword and had the other three back away. Asuna and Myia
removed their rapiers, and Argo readied the claws that were
attached to the back of her hands.
Seconds later, a humanoid creature emerged from the hole with a
wide, thin reptilian head like a cobra’s, a long, slender torso, and
human limbs. It was an ophidian, one of the snakemen that
appeared all throughout this tower. It was similar to the lizard-like
reptoids and fishy ichthyoids we’d fought already, but with its long
arms and spear, it had a fearsome range, as well as poison fangs, if
you could get past its reach. And it wasn’t just one—here came a
second…and a third.
I realized that we should have activated the Meditation buff before
entering the tower, but it was too late for that now. Fortunately, the
ophidians’ fangs were damaging poison, not the paralyzing kind, so
we could handle the effects.
“They’ll poison you if they bite! Don’t rush in; aim for the arms and
make them drop the spears! Argo, team up with Myia!” I
commanded.
They reacted quickly. Without Kizmel, the highest level in our party
actually belonged to Myia, but she was a child and had a very short
reach. Argo had the same problem—due to her weapon, not size—so
I thought it best for them to team up and wreak confusion.
Of the three ophidians, two had spears, and the third used a glaive.
Based on the armor ornamentation, I judged the glaive user to be the
leader and charged at it.
“Shrrrrl!” hissed the creature, flickering its tongue and jabbing with
the glaive. I sidestepped it, struck a shallow blow to the arm holding
272|P

the spear, and withdrew. Asuna, Argo, and Myia took their own
targets and spread out across the spacious room.
That reminds me. I guess Asuna’s not using that lance anymore…?
Taking advantage of my moment of distraction, the leader snake
used the sword skill Swift Lunge. It was a simple, single thrust, but
being at the very fastest level of all the sword skills in the game, it
was very tricky to deal with. If you didn’t sidestep the moment you
saw the visual light effect, you wouldn’t avoid it in time.
Instead, I stood my ground. I’d ordered the others to focus on
disarming, but accumulating damage bit by bit on the scaled arms of
the snakemen took time. We needed to catch up to Theano; we
couldn’t stop and drag out the very first fight in the tower.
I focused hard on the shining crimson tip of the spear, preparing a
Vertical skill with precise aim, angle, and timing, like I was threading
a needle. I wanted the body of the sword to press against the spear
as it dropped; if the angle was too weak, I couldn’t push aside the
skill, and if it went too deep, it would block the attack but knock my
sword back, too. Only when I scraped the spear at the optimal angle
would it change the thrust angle and still strike my target—the
Counter Parry technique.
The ophidian’s glaive nicked the left side of my chest as it passed me,
and my Vertical smashed the hand holding the spear. Triangular
scales flew into the air, and the snake arm fell clean off and
shattered.
“Jyashhh!” the snakeman snarled, trying to counterattack with its
other hand. But held with only one arm, the heavy glaive was much
slower. It had only just pulled back the spear for full momentum
when I recovered from my skill delay. I stepped farther forward,
putting myself into its poison fang range.

273|P

The ophidian curled its head back, going into the biting motion as if it
were hoping for this.
But I’d done it on purpose. As the cobra head swooped forward, I
gave it a three-part Sharp Nail skill.
The large fanged head of the ophidian was its greatest weapon and
weakness in one. The three slanting slashes all hit the snakeman’s
snout. It curled back abruptly, froze in place, then exploded into
pieces. I rushed through the expanding particles, saving my fist pump
for later, and plunged toward the side of the ophidian Asuna was
fighting.
We finished our fight against the three powerful ophidians in a bit
over two minutes, made sure we applied the Meditation buff this
time, then leaped through the hole in the wall. Asuna told me to face
away while we did it, and Argo, ever the businesswoman, offered to
buy the info about the skill. I told her “Later!” because we were in a
hurry.
Soon, we found more and more holes Theano made in walls, but we
never seemed to be any closer to her. She had to be fighting the
ophidians alone—and the golden cube’s effect shouldn’t work on the
snakemen—but she was clearing them out faster than our party of
four could.
I remembered that the ophidians in the tower took about five
minutes to re-pop, so if we stopped seeing monsters along the route,
we could assume we were within five minutes of catching up to
Theano. Yet, the ophidians, beetles, and magical monsters kept
coming strong. Within two or three battles, my other party members
got the hang of combat in this dungeon, and we started winning our
fights within a minute or less, but the fact that we didn’t seem to be
getting any closer was proof that Theano was very powerful, with or
without the cube.

274|P

Between her and Kysarah, who had taken all of our keys, if we were
going to see more and more ultrapowerful and freethinking (at least
in appearance) NPCs in the future, then, for better or for worse, they
were going to play a major role in getting through this deadly game.
They could be powerful allies or terrifying enemies—though not that
this was anything new.
At any rate, thanks to Theano providing us with a minimum-length
route skipping all the puzzles and traps, we were racing up the one
hundred meter tower with incredible speed. On the fifth floor, the
midpoint of the dungeon, there was supposed to be an ophidian
boss and some underlings, but when I peered into the chamber, all I
saw was a scattering of various loot items. For a moment, I was
terrified that some of Theano’s belongings would be among them,
but the far door was wide open, so I assumed she had passed
through safely.
“…At this rate, she might just beat the floor boss while she’s at it,”
murmured Asuna as she stared at the mountain of treasure. Argo
gulped down her potion and said wryly, “In that case, maybe she
could go on up the stairs and unlock the next floor, too…Still, even I
couldn’t see all’a this comin’. How’s this Theano so tough?”
Theano’s own daughter answered her. “My mother never ever
skipped on her daily training, and sometimes she would go out of
town by herself in the middle of the night and come home all bruised
in the morning. I think she was fighting monsters in the woods to the
south.”
“But…why would she do that…?” Asuna asked.
The girl in the gas mask shook her head. “I asked her many times, but
she wouldn’t tell me. But…now I wonder if all of that was in
preparation for this day.”

275|P

“Now that’s just ridiculous!” I wanted to shout. The “Curse of
Stachion” quest had gone off the rails because Morte had killed
Cylon. If it weren’t for that unpredictable event, it would have
proceeded like in the beta: Theano would rescue us from our
paralysis, we’d sneak into the mansion and convince Cylon, recover
the golden cube from the basement dungeon, calm the vengeful
ghost of Pithagrus, and finish the quest.
Theano wasn’t weak when I fought alongside her in the beta, but her
level and stats weren’t far off from mine, and definitely not enough
that she could blaze through the labyrinth tower solo like this. If
Myia was to be believed, the official release version of Theano had
been leveling up for ten years, long before Cylon was killed, for a
different purpose than what I saw during the beta.
“Welp, let’s loot this stuff and get goin’,” said Argo, bringing me back
to my senses.
I glanced at the items lying around. “Huh…? We’re going to loot
this?”
“Well, it’s either gonna go bad just sittin’ around, or the other guilds
are gonna snatch it up when they get here.”
“I guess…but it was Theano who beat the mid-boss,” I said, trapped
between courtesy and desire.
Myia looked at me, perplexed. “Mother left these behind because
she just couldn’t carry them, I think. If you use your Mystic Scribing
art to collect them, I’m sure she would appreciate it.”
“Ah, g-good point…I’ll do that, then…”
I promptly opened my window and tossed the weapons, armor,
materials, and other sundry items into my inventory. Argo picked up
the slack quickly, and even Asuna hesitantly joined in.

276|P

In less than a minute, we’d cleared out all the loot, and our HP was
back to full. “Okay, let’s…”
“Go,” I was going to say, but Asuna stuck her index finger against my
lips.
“Wait. I just heard something.”
“Huh…?”
I shut my mouth and focused on my ears. It did seem like I was
hearing very faint yelling and clanging. But it was from below, not
above.
“…Sounds like Lin-Kiba are catchin’ up…” whispered Argo. She
listened two more seconds, then added, “But they’re still far off.
We’re only hearin’ the sounds of combat because of all the huge
holes in the walls. It’s gonna take ’em a good ten minutes or so to get
here…Whaddaya think? Should we wait?”
“No, let’s go,” I said promptly. “Catching up to Theano is a higher
priority than grouping up with the rest of them.”
“I agree,” said Asuna.
Myia lowered her head. “I just…I don’t know what to say…”
I placed my hands on her shoulders and spun her around. “You can
figure that out once everything is settled. C’mon, let’s run!”
“…Okay!”
The group headed for the open door. In the second half of the
labyrinth, the level of the random enemies rose noticeably, but
checking the mid-boss’s loot as we ran, I found an excellent rapier (if
not as good as the Chivalric Rapier) and a set of claws that was +5 to
agility, which I gave to Myia and Argo, respectively. We continued
upward at about the same speed as we had through the lower half of
the dungeon.

277|P

The next thing I knew, it was after eight o’clock, but oddly, the
crushing exhaustion I felt on the shore of Lake Talpha did not return.
I was certain that the next time it happened I wouldn’t be able to
recover, but for now, all I could do was keep running. Asuna should
have been just as tired, but she wasn’t complaining one bit.
“Hey…” she murmured, drawing a glance from me.
“Hmm…?”
“Have you noticed it’s been a while since any enemies showed up?”
“Oh, now that you mention it…”
She was right. The ophidians and other monsters that had
persistently shown up even past the mid-boss chamber had been
rather quiet the last five minutes. Not because their pop pattern had
changed, but because someone ahead of us was clearing them out,
and they hadn’t re-popped yet. We were within five minutes’
distance of Theano.
Our present location was in the middle of the tower’s eighth floor,
and the boss chamber was on the tenth. At our current pace, we
might still be a bit too late to catch her before she reached the
chamber.
“This is a gamble…but I think we should throw caution to the wind
and just sprint,” I suggested. Asuna agreed, and even Argo and Myia
looked back at us and nodded.
Before, we had been carefully monitoring for the growls or shuffling
of monsters, or the glimpse of red cursors out of the corner of the
eyes, but now I jumped ahead at full speed. I often conserved my top
speed while working with the front-line group, but I had the lowest
agility of the four present, and now I raced with all of my ability. The
textures and joints of the walls and floor turned to a blur, and dry air
buffeted my face.

278|P

When sprinting within a dungeon, your ability to turn—your
cornering, if this were a racing game—was crucial. Without shoes
with excellent grip or a high proficiency in the Sprint skill, you might
fail to rotate your momentum and crash into the far wall on a turn.
So I gave up on ordinary turning and went back to Wall-Running for a
few steps first, like I’d done when Asuna and I raced down the stairs
at the inn in Stachion.
Asuna and Argo had mastered this style of turning, too, so I went to a
Wall-Run on the next left turn. Only when I dropped back to the floor
did I mentally kick myself. We had Myia the NPC with us. There was
no way she could pick up this sort of outside-the-box hack that
defied common logic.
I glanced over my shoulder as I slowed down—and found that I was
worried for nothing. Myia, who was in front of Asuna, nimbly ran five
steps along the wall, as though gravity meant nothing to her, before
transitioning back to the floor. I had to face forward and speed up,
lest she overtake me. Apparently, swordfighting wasn’t the only
thing Theano had taught her daughter.
Knowing that there was no point to going slower now, I went back to
the spring and Wall-Ran around the next turn. Obviously, we had to
stop and determine the direction when it came to T-intersections
and crossroads, and we always chose the route that did not suggest
the presence of monsters or that had loot strewn across the floor. At
a dead-end, we found yet another hole in the wall, through which
there was a staircase on the right. We took it at full speed.
The tenth floor of the labyrinth was almost entirely taken up by the
boss chamber, so the ninth was the last floor of actual dungeon.
Normally, this was an extremely dangerous place with vicious
monsters blocking the way, but Theano’s path left behind nothing
but treasure—not even a single scarab scurrying along. We didn’t
have time to stop and inspect the ordinary monsters’ loot, but Argo
279|P

keenly identified just the rare goods as we ran, hooking them with
her claws and tossing them into her window. Even I couldn’t mimic
that kind of dexterity and opportunism.
After three minutes of running down hallways and through giant
holes, skipping all the terrain and gimmicks of the dungeon’s ninth
floor, we came to an elevated walkway with a stately design, leading
to a huge set of stairs. Those would lead to the tenth floor, but there
was no one on the walkway or the stairs yet.
I bit my lip. It seemed like Theano must have already gone into the
boss chamber…
“Mother…!” Myia wailed, lifting her gas mask and racing past me.
“H-hey!” I shouted, going after her, until I noticed something. There
were faint footsteps approaching from ahead, though the person
making them was unseen. There were two sets of stairs that met in a
landing in the middle before turning back around. Someone—no,
definitely Theano—was climbing the stairs after the turnaround,
where we couldn’t see. She was less than thirty meters away, but the
boss chamber was just above us.
Myia crossed the elevated walkway with a speed even Argo couldn’t
match and flew up the left-hand set of stairs. At this rate, Theano
and Myia might jump into the chamber alone and cause the door to
shut behind them. I had no other choice but to draw my sword and
rest it on my shoulder.
“Nwaaah!” I shouted, launching off the floor with the Sonic Leap
sword skill, zooming across the other half of the walkway to the
stairs, and intentionally missing the landing. I lost a few pixels of HP,
but it kept me rolling directly up the stairs to the landing, where I
caught up to Myia.
My skill delay wore off while I was tumbling, so I kicked back off the
wall toward the second flight of stairs, looking up to a figure rushing
280|P

up the steps ahead. It was a woman with golden blond hair, rapier in
her right hand and a large cube in her left. The yellow cursor hanging
above her head said THEANO.
“Theano!!”
“Mother!!”
But the woman took three or four more steps and only stopped one
stair before the tenth floor. She spun around, ponytail and long
deep-green skirt whirling. She looked down on us with ash-green
eyes the same shade as Myia’s.
This wasn’t my first time facing Theano, even in the official release.
When we got the quest from Cylon at the mansion in Stachion, the
first person we went to talk to was Theano the former servant. But
she was dressed in a plain apron dress and looked like any other
housewife NPC. Now she was dressed in gleaming, fine leather armor
and held a rapier. She looked like a veteran swordfighter.
Her regal beauty softened somewhat, and in a soft but clear voice,
she said, “Myia…Kirito. I expected that you would follow after me,
but I did not think you would catch up.”
“Mother…” Myia repeated, unable to do anything but clutch the
handle of her rapier with both hands.
Instead, I spoke for the both of us, choosing my words carefully.
“Theano, I don’t know what you’re trying to do. But please don’t
charge ahead alone. Stay here and talk with us first…with Myia.”
Just then, Asuna and Argo caught up and stood to our sides. Theano
looked at all four of us in turn and spoke to her daughter again.
“You’ve gotten so strong, Myia. I’m sorry for disappearing without a
word…but this is my role. As long as this cube exists, the cursed
puzzles of Stachion will never disappear, and the bloody battle over

281|P

the inheritance will continue. With Cylon dead, there is no one to
hold back the curse…It must be destroyed.”
“But how…?!” I asked her desperately. “What are you going to do
with it?!”
Theano’s response was to stare right at me. “The cube cannot be
destroyed in this state. But if returned to the place where it originally
belonged, the power that protects it will vanish.”
“The place where it belonged…?” Asuna mumbled. She leaned
forward a few centimeters. “Is that the boss chamber…the room
where the guardian of the Pillar of the Heavens resides?”
“Not quite, Asuna,” Theano said, perfectly recalling and pronouncing
the name of the fencer whom she’d only briefly met three days
earlier. “The place where it belongs is not in the room but in the
creature itself. This cube was originally part of the guardian. Long,
long ago, Master Pithagrus pulled it out himself and brought it back
to Stachion…Well, at the time, it was just a nameless little village. It
was the cube’s power that helped the town grow into the splendid
form it has today, but it was never meant to fall into human hands…”
Theano paused there, then gazed at the golden cube in her left hand.
That’s a part of the boss’s body? And the previous lord, Pithagrus,
separated it from the boss and used its power to create the town of
Stachion…?
I struggled to digest this new information that I had never learned in
the beta.
The boss of the sixth floor in the beta was a large cube with each
face split into three-by-three sections of red, blue, yellow, green,
white, and black—essentially a giant Rubik’s Cube with hands and
feet. If you struck the edges with your weapons, they rotated ninety
degrees in that direction. As you repeated it and matched up the

282|P

colors, the little cubes would scatter and spill off, revealing a core
that could be damaged—but I didn’t remember any golden cube.
Then again, it wasn’t rare at all for the floor bosses to have been
altered between the beta test and the official release. In fact, all of
them from the first to fifth floor had been updated in some way,
large or small, so the sixth could easily be different, too. The
question was, what effect would it have to return the golden cube
that Pithagrus removed? The first possibility that popped into my
mind was that it would recover its original power, i.e. become
superpowered. We had to beat the boss and move on to the seventh
floor, so that was something to be avoided.
“Listen, Theano,” said the info dealer, who never broke character.
“The name’s Argo—I’m tight with Kirito and Asuna. I was hopin’ you
might tell me something. What exactly happens if you return that
cube to the guardian beast’s body? You don’t think it might get so
super-tough, even you can’t defeat it, do ya?”
Will she understand what the term tight with means? I wondered, my
mind straying. Theano didn’t seem bothered by it, though.
“You adventurers are hoping to defeat the guardian in battle to
move on to the next floor, I presume…I don’t know the full details,
but I am certain that returning the cube will cause the guardian to
move and attack. But this is not a bad thing for you. While the cube is
out of the guardian’s body, the guardian is protected by an unseen
power that makes it impossible to harm.”
““Whaaaa—?!”” Argo and I exclaimed in unison. We looked at each
other, then Theano, then each other again.
If what she said was true, the golden cube was absolutely necessary
to beating the floor boss at all. But where had that ever been hinted
at…?

283|P

And yet, I had to remind myself: The “proper” route for the “Curse of
Stachion” test was just what I knew from the beta test. Cylon’s death
certainly twisted its path, but if it had passed normally, there could
certainly have been some information relating to the floor boss at
the end—and a hint that the cube would be key to the battle.
“…Meaning that when the cube is put back, and the guardian moves
again, we can attack it, and beating it will destroy the cube?” Asuna
asked. Theano said nothing but nodded firmly.
“Then, Mother—!” Myia cried, breaking her long silence. “Let me
help you! I know the guardian beast is terribly dangerous, and I know
you are worried about me…but if you go into the chamber alone and
never come back, I won’t be able to survive on my own!”
I didn’t miss the powerful look of conflict and indecision on Theano’s
features. This wasn’t just some pre-written story event—Myia and
Theano had their own independent personalities and were acting in
ways perfectly faithful to them.
Seconds later, Theano clenched her eyes shut, thought a moment,
then opened them again. She put the rapier from her hand into its
sheath on her left side and smiled. “All right, Myia. You’ve become
so, so much stronger than I ever realized…I taught you the sword so
you could survive on your own, even without me around, but that
was all my own selfish idea. Thank you…please lend me your
strength, Myia.”
“I will!” Myia exclaimed, casting aside the strangely grown-up air
she’d always worn and leaping up the steps to embrace her mother.
Theano brushed her daughter’s head and looked at us.
“Kirito, Asuna, Argo, I’m grateful to you for protecting my child.”
It was your child who was protecting us, I thought, nodding back to
her. The three of us ascended the steps and stood at the entrance to
the tenth floor with Theano. With her left arm around her daughter,
284|P

Theano extended a silent hand toward us, which we shook in turn. A
fifth HP bar appeared in my view. Hesitantly, I checked the level: 32.
Hrrmm…? I wondered, taking a quick step back. It was a high
number, especially to me, a newly made level-21 swordsman. But it
didn’t seem so high that she should have been able to destroy
monsters on her own that much faster than the party of me, Asuna,
Argo, and level-23 Myia. Her gear was fine, to be sure, but nothing
fancier than what was sold at the stores.
But there was no use second-guessing Theano’s power now. If we
waited a few minutes, the main body of the front-line group would
reach us, too. Surely Theano would agree to fight with the rest of
them, knowing it would make Myia safer.
I whispered a request to Asuna to explain the situation to them. She
gave me a glance that said Honestly? Good grief…before approaching
Theano. I exhaled and looked around.
A menacingly decorated hallway continued on from our position for
about ten meters, ending in a massive set of bronze double doors. I
took a few steps closer to examine them and saw a decorative relief
modeled after the exterior of the tower—or of Stachion itself—in a
nine-by-nine grid of squares. Beyond this point, the sixth-floor boss
awaited, its name and form still unclear.
Normally, you would want at least three trips for scouting, but
according to Theano’s explanation, you couldn’t attack the boss until
the golden cube was placed back into it, and it probably couldn’t be
removed twice, once it was there again. I had a suspicion, based on
that activation trick, that the doors to the boss chamber would stay
closed until the fight was over.
But in any case, we were here. It had been a string of unexpected
developments, but…this wasn’t a single-player RPG, it was a VRMMO
with eight thousand players trapped inside. There would surely be

285|P

more and more unexpected things happening to us, and we had to
solve and overcome them as we made our way upward. Up to that
far-distant hundredth floor.
I spun around forcefully and returned to my party members’ side.
Fifteen minutes later, the rest of the player group charged noisily up
the stairs—and got an awkward smile in greeting from me. With the
help of Asuna and Argo, I gave the skeptical Lind and Kibaou as much
of an explanation of why we were here as was possible.
“Oh, so that NPC was with y’all, then?” grumbled Kibaou, but when
we told them that the golden cube was a necessary item to beat the
boss, there was no more bickering from the two guilds.
After a meeting and cooldown period, we got down to arranging the
raid party for the boss fight. Teams A, B, and C went to the three
parties of Kibaou’s Aincrad Liberation Squad. Teams D, E, and F were
made up of Lind’s Dragon Knights Brigade. Team G was Asuna, Argo,
Myia, Theano, and me. Sadly, members of Agil’s Bro Squad were all
low in agility and not suited for long sprints, so they hadn’t taken
part in the chase.
So we were a bit low on the tank quotient, but we’d have to make up
for it with mobility, I thought as I leaned against the wall a distance
away from the rest of the group. Just to be certain, I scanned the
faces of the ALS and DKB present. There were a few new members in
the mix, but again, I didn’t see Morte or Joe.
That was a good thing, of course, but it also meant we hadn’t solved
the question of what the man in the black poncho and his friends
were doing, allying themselves with the fallen elves. Was it to get the
Spines of Shmargor, those paralyzing throwing needles? They were
very powerful weapons, but would they really kidnap the members
of Qusack and force them to poison the spirit tree for something as
minor as getting a good weapon?

286|P

“…I wonder if they’ll try something else this time,” said a voice next
to me. It was Asuna, staring down the stairs with a hard expression.
She’d been on the same train of thought.
“Hmm…If they are, I don’t think Morte and Joe alone could climb this
tower to do it. If they’ve got some plans in mind, it’ll be from the
seventh floor, right?”
“I…I suppose,” she said, but the note of unease was still there in her
profile. Between nearly dying along with Cylon and the attack on
Castle Galey, the PK gang had us on the defensive all throughout this
floor. I understood why she didn’t want to let her guard down, lest it
happen again.
I glanced around, hesitated, then worked up the courage to move my
left hand to the side. My fingers searched for Asuna’s hand,
and…didn’t grab it entirely, but I did squeeze the joints of our
pinkies. Her delicate hand twitched, but she didn’t yell at me or pull
it away. A few seconds later, Asuna’s hand moved in return,
enveloping my fingertip in her palm with an awkwardly reserved
pressure.
It was nine PM on January 4, 2023.
The raid party, all preparations complete, lined up in front of the
double doors. At the front, Kibaou barked a short but forceful
encouragement to the group and pushed the doors open.

287|P

288|P

IT WAS HUGE.
The tenth floor of the labyrinth tower was almost entirely taken up
by the boss chamber, so that wasn’t a surprise in and of itself, but my
first impression upon seeing the sixth-floor boss room for the first
time in four and a half months was that it was just huge. The walls,
floor, and ceiling were a bluish-gray color, and the weak lighting
made the corners of the room look black. There was a huge star
drawn on the ceiling high overhead, a reminder that the tower, and
this room at the top of it, was actually pentagonal in shape.
Viewed from the desert below, the width of the tower was about
half its height. If it was a hundred meters tall, then the diagonal
would be about fifty meters, and each side…
“Hey, Asuna, what’s the ratio of the side of a pentagon to a diagonal,
again…?” I murmured. The fencer shot me a look that said Why now?
“It’s one to one plus the root of five over two. That’s about one point
six one eight.”
“One point six one eight…” I repeated. “So if the diagonal was fifty
meters, a side would be…about thirty meters?”
“Closer to thirty-one, to be precise, but it probably doesn’t matter
that much.”
“I see…”
The only reason we could chat about unimportant topics like this in
the boss chamber was because we were waiting for the ALS and DKB
to get set up in position. It seemed like we still had another thirty
seconds to go. Asuna turned to me this time and said, “One to one
plus the root of five over two is called the Golden Ratio.”
“Golden…?”
289|P

“It’s found in the length-to-width ratio of the Parthenon or in the
upper and lower halves of the Venus de Milo…even human faces.
The width of the nose and mouth are considered well-balanced if
their ratio is 1:1.618, apparently.”
“Ohhh,” I murmured, staring at Asuna’s face in an attempt to see if it
was true. She promptly jabbed me in the side, and Argo had to warn
us, “Hey, we’re in a boss chamber!” Myia giggled.
At last, Kibaou shouted from the other side of the room. “Placements
are complete! We’re ready to go!”
“Got it!” I shouted, glancing behind me briefly. The double doors,
which jutted inward about ten meters from one of those pentagon
sides, were still wide open. I prayed silently that they would stay that
way and looked over to Theano, who stood next to her daughter.
“Well…go ahead, Theano.”
“I will,” she said, and the warrior focused on the golden cube in her
hands. I saw some kind of expression ripple across her beautiful
features like waves on a pond, then vanish. “Then let’s begin. Don’t
go too far forward, Myia,” she warned her daughter, beginning to
walk toward the center of the chamber.
Where she headed sat a very strange object.
Its shape was quite simple. It was a cube about a half meter to a side.
It was as black and unreflective as if carved right out of charcoal, and
though the details were hard to make out in the dim lighting, there
was a square hole about twenty centimeters across on the side
facing us. It was obvious at a glance that the golden cube would fit
inside perfectly.
“…Once the cube goes in, it’ll be so flush, we won’t be able to pull it
back out…” I noted idly.

290|P

On my right, Argo said, “From my inspection earlier, there’s a li’l hole
on the opposite side of the cube.”
“Oh…so you could shove a stick inside and push it back out…?”
“A stick…or…” Argo started to say, then clammed up. Theano had
crouched and stuck the cube into the hollow.
The pitch-black hole accepted the cube as though it was oiled up;
there was no scraping or catching whatsoever. The moment the
black-and-gold surface became one, the dark bluish floor rumbled
briefly.
Suddenly, the black cube began to shine with golden light. Theano
quickly retreated, and the raid members readied themselves at a
safe distance. Many swords and spears reflected the shining light as
the cube silently left the floor and floated into the air.
It came to a stop about three meters off the ground, then began to
rotate sideways. It started slow but picked up noticeable speed,
becoming one with the gloom. Only the line of the golden cube itself
remained visible, creating a ring of light in the air.
Grrrng!
The air shook again. A number of golden cubes appeared, practically
out of thin air, and began to spin as well. But in fact, though I
couldn’t count them directly, I knew exactly how many of the cubes
there were: twenty-six.
The golden cubes surrounded the rapidly spinning black cube and
began to affix themselves to it. The rotation gradually slowed and
came to a stop, revealing one golden block that was three times its
previous size—now nearly two meters to a side.
The twenty-six cubes had lined themselves up three by three to
connect together, but they were not fused; there was a tiny bit of

291|P

space left between them. In other words, they formed a gigantic
Rubik’s Cube.
“It’s just like the beta! If you hit the edges with your weapons, they’ll
rotate to…” I stopped short, noticing something different.
In the beta, the sides were red, blue, green, yellow, white, and black.
Here, all the sides were the same golden color. Now there was no
way to line them up…Or they were already lined up, I supposed.
With the roar of a combustion engine, the twenty-six smaller cubes
began to rotate in all directions at random. When they stopped,
there was a bright pattern on the faces of each nine-squared side of
the cube, for fifty-four squares in total.
No, that wasn’t a pattern. It was more familiar than that, something
written…
“N…numbers…?!” Asuna gasped, right as a single-bar HP gauge
appeared in the air over the giant Rubik’s Cube. Below the bar was
the boss’s official name, shining in bright English letters: THE
IRRATIONAL CUBE.
And as I expected, the double doors boomed shut at that moment.
“Here it comes…!” shouted a voice, most likely Lind’s.
In reaction to that call, three of the boss’s eight corners emitted
pale-gray lines that stabbed at the raid party. I summoned all the
lung power I had and bellowed, “Evaaaade!!”
Immediately, red laser beams shot forth, tracing the gray lines. They
emitted terrifying swooping, sizzling sounds as small explosions
erupted at three places in the chamber. Fortunately, no one took a
direct hit, but I did see a few of the many HP bars in my vision dip a
little due to local heat damage.
The color and name were different from the beta—it had been the
Irritating Cube—but this attack, at least, was very familiar. Aiming
292|P

lines that were hard to pick up came first, followed a second later by
the lasers. It would take a huge chunk of HP from any lightly armored
players it struck, but as long as you were calm and observant, it
wasn’t that hard to dodge them…Assuming you didn’t trip or get
frozen, of course.
Hoping to get a hint from the boss’s English name, I turned to my
wiser partner and said rapidly, “What does the word irrational mean,
Asuna?! In the beta, it was irritating, which I looked up later…”
“It’s kind of like illogical—or incoherent.”
“Illogical…” I repeated. No kidding! Even a child could line up the
colors, but these numbers…Wait, maybe numbers were the same
thing…?
“Are you saying that we have to fill each side with the same
number?!” I said, hoping I’d found the solution, but Argo shattered
that hope just as quickly as it arrived.
“But the numbers go up ta nine!”
She was right. The glowing Arabic numerals were arranged randomly
from one to nine, meaning that it would be impossible to match
them up on the six separate sides like a classic Rubik’s Cube. I even
considered the brainteaser-like option of flipping the nine over to be
a six, but that wouldn’t be enough, and the six and nine had
distinctly separate designs anyway.
As though an NPC was what I really needed for a hint, Theano came
back our way. “Theano, what do we do with the numb—?” I started
to ask, but the woman just shook her head, looking pensive.
“I don’t know, either. The legend around the mansion said only that
to destroy the golden cube, it must be returned to the body of the
tower’s guardian…”
“Oh, okay…”

293|P

In the meantime, the boss kept firing its lasers from the center of the
room. The raid members weaved and jumped out of the way and
struck the floating object with their weapons. Each blow caused the
rows or columns of the cube to rotate ninety degrees, but there was
no change to its HP at all. It seemed the numbered cube was
invincible, and we needed to solve its puzzle to pull the blocks off.
But there was nothing we could do without figuring out what kind of
puzzle it was.
The unease and frustration that filled the chamber finally sparked,
and an orange flash went off near the boss. Someone had used a
sword skill on it.
“Don’t…!” I shouted on instinct, but it was too late, of course. A twopart spear strike sent up bright sparks from the face of the Irrational
Cube, but it did not a single pixel of damage—and the boss sent out
an aiming line as if on cue.
“Dodge!” Kibaou bellowed. A gang of players near the line all leaped
at once, except for the spearman, who was still frozen from the skill.
The red laser seared him dead-on.
“Aaaah!” shrieked the player, right as I heard a dull explosion. It
looked like Schinkenspeck from the ALS. He was blasted off his feet
and collapsed to the ground. One of the HP bars from Team C went
down into the yellow zone, over halfway to zero. His friends helped
move him over to the wall, but it would take some time for him to
heal up.
“…Maybe we should retreat for now, Kirito…” Asuna said, sounding
tense. I bobbed my head somewhat awkwardly.
It was clearly the right option. The boss was invincible, and we didn’t
know how to undo it. Letting the battle drag on in this state was
inevitably going to lead to disastrous results. But…

294|P

I spun around and caught sight of the doors, which were shut tight.
Asuna gasped; she hadn’t realized they’d closed.
“…We don’t know for sure they won’t open again,” I said, out of
hope, if nothing else, and raced for them, crossing the ten meters in
the blink of an eye and practically slamming my free hand against the
door. The thick bronze metal rattled a tiny bit but did not budge. It
was locked…
“…?!”
Suddenly, a series of pale lights flashed across my vision, and I turned
away. I held my breath, thinking it was an attack from the boss, but
felt nothing. I looked back and gasped again.
Numbers.
There was a grid of light, glowing on the surface of the door, with
Arabic numerals in the boxes. They were in the same font as the
ones on the boss cube’s body…but there were more blank squares
here than squares with numbers inside.
I took a step back for a better look, right as Asuna arrived beside me.
Together we shouted, ““A sudoku puzzle?!””
There was no doubt about it. The exact same kind of puzzles as in the
teleport square of Stachion but filling the entire width of the massive
doors.
“So if we solve this, the doors will open?!” said Argo over our
shoulders.
“I…I think so?” I said uncertainly. “But…there’s just no way…”
It wasn’t my style to give up before even trying something, but there
was no other option this time. This puzzle had twenty-seven rows
and columns of sudoku puzzles, each one in the nine-by-nine format,
for a total of 729. That was one more than in the square at Stachion,
but the layout was identical.
295|P

In my mind, I replayed something Asuna had said four days earlier.
At a glance, these look like maximum difficulty, so even an expert
would take a good twenty minutes to solve one. Multiplying that by
728 would be 14,560 minutes…divided by sixty, that makes 242 hours
and forty minutes…
Two hundred and forty-two hours. A little over ten whole days. That
would be an entire day if split between ten people. And trying to do
them while avoiding the boss’s attacks the entire time? Impossible.
“I’m guessing even the number layouts are exactly the same as in
Stachion’s square…” Asuna whispered, her voice hoarse. “We should
have solved the puzzles in Stachion, then come to this room by the
end of the day. That was the minimum requirement for fighting this
boss…”
“But how would we…?”
…know that? I tried to say. But I remembered looking up at these
doors from the other side and seeing the grid pattern on the relief. It
was a nine-by-nine grid. If I had just made the connection to sudoku,
I could have remembered about the teleport square in Stachion.
“……Damn!”
I was about to slam a clenched fist against the cold, glowing puzzle—
when I heard a voice behind me.
“Do we just need to solve the puzzles, Kirito?”
My hand paused in midair. I turned around and saw Myia, her gas
mask off, staring at me with big eyes.
“You…you can solve this?”
“Yep!” she chirped, much more appropriately for her age now that
her mother was around again. She trotted up to the door and
reached for the puzzle in the bottom-right corner. Her finger traced
the empty spots with dizzying speed until she settled on one glowing
296|P

space to tap. When a window appeared with all the digits to choose
from, she picked a seven. The other spaces disappeared, replaced by
a single large seven. It took her a total of ten seconds.
“Wha…? How…how did you do that so fast…?” I gaped.
Myia spun to face me and beamed. “Well, ever since I was a little girl,
I solved these puzzles in the town square with my mother every
day.”
That explanation didn’t cover the speed she exhibited…but then I
remembered something. Kizmel had no major connection to puzzles,
but she had solved that 15 puzzle in the secret-key dungeon in a
matter of seconds. If an AI could solve an NP-high problem that fast,
these sudoku puzzles must be no harder than simple arithmetic
equations to them.
“I’ll help you, too, of course,” said Theano, who stepped up next to
Myia. I looked from their faces to the puzzle behind me and back.
At ten seconds per puzzle, it would take 7,290 seconds to solve 729
of them. That would be a bit over 120 minutes. With the two of
them, that would be sixty minutes—an hour. Maybe there was a
chance…
“…Please, Theano and Myia, do your best.”
They nodded, set up at the right and left corners, and began solving,
their fingers flying. I grabbed the shoulder of my still-stunned partner
and said, “Asuna, we’ve got to go grab that boss’s attention. Our
assignment is to dodge it for the next hour somehow.”
“O…okay, if you say so.”
“A-and what should I do?” asked Argo.
“When Myia needs to solve the problems higher on the door, you lift
her up!” I shouted, and started to run with Asuna toward the center
of the chamber—but hit the brakes just as suddenly.
297|P

“Wh-what’s the big idea?!”
“Hey, listen,” I said, “if you select the right number from a pull-down
menu, can’t we just go and select every number starting from one?”
The fencer gave me the most annoyed look in our entire personal
history together and shoved her face so close to mine, our noses
nearly touched. “If they set up the puzzle that way, it’s obviously
going to fail us as soon as we make a mistake!”
“…Oh. Right.”
Chastised, I allowed us to run back to the boss for real this time.
The hour that passed after this point was the longest and hardest
hour of all the many I’d spent in Aincrad so far. The boss battles of
the second and fifth floors had been tough, but I just focused on
fighting the enemy and didn’t process the passage of time. Those
were fights to win and move on. This was different—we were
evading attacks for an entire hour just to escape the room.
Watch for the aiming beams from the eight corners of the Irrational
Cube, then dodge. That was all it involved, but the finders were hard
to see, and their timing and location were nastily designed. Often, it
would strike the place you dodged on a time delay. It tried to gather
multiple players in one place to collide with one another and
sometimes incessantly went after a single individual. Whatever
thought process it followed, it didn’t seem like a simple algorithm.
When Asuna and I joined the front line of battle, we explained the
situation to the ALS and DKB, of course, and it had a slight, if
undeniable, effect on overall morale. Until that point, everyone had
assumed that if the numbers were rotated enough (however it was
supposed to work), they would eventually be able to inflict damage.
But the intended numbers were a mystery, and anyone would be
disappointed to learn that they needed to dodge for an entire hour

298|P

just to escape. And if your level of concentration dipped, so did your
mobility, making the danger rise.
The next thing I knew, over ten of the thirty-six other raid members
were back along the wall after taking direct laser blasts. The
Irrational Cube hadn’t moved far from the center of the room
because that was where the majority of the players were. The more
people who retreated to the walls, the sooner the boss would start
to target them, too—and the wider its movement range, the more
likely it might stray toward the entrance doors, where it could attack
Myia and Theano in the act of desperately solving all the sudoku
puzzles. That was the one thing we had to avoid.
Asuna and I shared thoughts with a single instant of eye contact, and
I gave the boss the three-part Sharp Nail sword skill. The HP bar
didn’t budge, of course, but the hate I built up from the cube caused
all three targeting lines to aim for me. By that time, however, Asuna
had already lifted me in her arms and raced off with me while my
skill delay was still active. There was an explosion behind us, but we
suffered no damage, just a little prickle of heat on the back.
Next, Asuna gave the boss the three-part Triangular skill, and it was
my turn to move her. That should be enough to keep the enemy
focused on the two of us.
Naturally, the algorithm wasn’t so simple that it would solely focus
on the players with the highest hate quotient, and it occasionally
strayed to go after others. But if we could draw half the lasers with
our high agility, that would give the other six parties some major
breathing room.
“Kirito, ahead to the left!”
I followed Asuna’s direction to avoid an aiming beam I couldn’t see
and dashed in that direction. When applicable, I returned the favor.

299|P

After this was repeated enough times, something strange began to
happen. Every once in a while, before I even heard Asuna’s voice, I
felt like I knew which way to go. It happened to her, too. More than
once, I called out “Right!” after Asuna was already jumping that way.
It was as though our minds were connected on some other channel
beyond just voice and ears…
It was a painful fight, knowing that it would not end in triumph, but I
did feel an undeniable kind of elation as I dodged and wove around
the targeting lines. When I had a moment to check my window for
the time in the few instants the boss traveled away from me, the
minutes crawled agonizingly slowly, but finally, a few minutes after
ten in the evening—
“It’s the last one, Kirito!” came Myia’s young but firm voice from the
back of the chamber. I leaped backward on instinct and glanced at
the doors. Nearly all the sudoku puzzles on their surface had the
correct numbers on them, leaving only the central puzzle, which
Theano was in the process of solving now.
She hit the key box, selected a number from the pull-down menu,
and it promptly enlarged and began to glow.
As expected, over the course of an hour, they’d solved 729 puzzles. A
rumble ran through the doors and the rest of the chamber as well. A
line of light appeared through the center of the closed doors, and
there was the loud clicking sound of a lock unlatching, telling us that
our escape route was opening at last.
“Let’s retreat to the hallway! Members undergoing healing, get
outside first!” commanded Lind, swinging his scimitar. A dozen-plus
players drinking potions along the wall stood up and began to run
toward the doors. Even the Irrational Cube, which had been wildly
firing its lasers just seconds ago, stopped in seeming recognition of
the open door.

300|P

At the very least, we wouldn’t have to worry about the entire frontline group wiping out. It sucked that we couldn’t knock even a single
pixel off the boss’s HP bar, but that was because we were missing a
crucial piece of information. If we went back and cleared out all the
quests in Stachion or Murutsuki, we would find out whatever way we
were meant to line up the boss’s numbers…
“Kirito,” Asuna whispered, grabbing my elbow. I saw that she was
looking at the doors, which were still closed. She was sensing
something, but she couldn’t yet tell what it was, her body language
said.
I stared at the huge double doors twenty meters away, feeling the
time gradually lengthen.
729 puzzles had turned into 729 numbers that glowed silently at us.
729…which was twenty-seven squared. Twenty-seven rows and
twenty-seven columns.
A three-by-three grid of nine-by-nine number blocks.
I craned my neck, looking back at the floating Irrational Cube in the
center of the room, then to the door again. I sucked in as much air as
my lungs could handle and screamed, “Stop!!!”
The player just a few meters from the door stopped reaching for it
and turned in the direction of my voice. The DKB’s Shivata was
closest to me. He looked aghast. “What’s wrong? Aren’t we getting
out of here?!”
“Wait, I think…those numbers…”
I shot Asuna a look and started running until I had thrust myself in
front of the door with my hands out in a sign for everyone to keep
back. Then I waited. If my hunch was correct, this puzzle wasn’t
meant to create an escape route. Clearing it would open the door,

301|P

but that was probably a trick. If we just waited, I was certain,
certain…
The raid party’s confusion, irritation, and haste grew thicker and
darker by the second. Five, six, seven…When nearly thirty seconds
had passed since Theano finished the last puzzle, it finally happened.
The 729 numbers suddenly flashed.
Over half the numbers vanished, as though burned away by the light.
In the various blank spots of the grid, there were faintly glowing
boxes. Lastly, four of the grid lines thickened, cutting the entire
pattern into nine-by-nine chunks.
“Ah…!” Asuna gasped behind me. To my sides, Myia and Theano
were equally shocked.
It wasn’t a random and meaningless string of numbers arranged in
twenty-seven rows and columns. It was a set of nine new sudoku
puzzles.
Gaoooong…A tremendous sound somewhere between a machine
and the roar of a living creature shook the room. I spun around and
saw that the Irrational Cube was moving again. And not just
that…three of its four vertical faces were now growing long arms
made of dozens of small cubes. The last face began to glow brightly.
“It’s comin’!” bellowed Kibaou from the back, readying his sword.
Lind issued a similar order to his followers.
“Retreat canceled! Keep healing if you’re damaged, come back and
remake formation if you’re fine!”
They, too, had sensed that the boss’s attacks were going to intensify
but that it meant there was now a chance to actually beat it.
“Myia! Theano! Handle these puzzles, too!” I shouted. They sprang
into action at the doors and began to slide their palms over the much
larger puzzles. Ten seconds later, they pressed key boxes in unison
302|P

and selected their answers. Those numbers grew larger and shone
brighter.
Mother and daughter completed their puzzles at the exact same
speed, Theano taking the higher puzzles and Myia going for the low
ones. Four, six, eight they completed, leaving just one more to go.
There were fierce blasts and crashes and shouts from behind them,
but they did their best to tune it out and focus on the moment.
Theano put her hand on the center puzzle and selected a five from
the menu. The number expanded to fill the space.
The moment all the puzzles were finished, the doors shone with even
more light than the previous time. I took several steps back and
memorized the order of the nine mammoth numbers on the door.
“Thank you…We’ll handle the rest!” I told them, turning back. I raced
toward the raid party and shouted as loud as my throat could handle,
“From top left across, it’s eight, three, four, one, five, nine, six,
seven, two!!”
There was a moment of silence.
Then a dull roar arose from all around. With the numbers we needed
revealed, the lowered morale began to rise again. In this situation,
the teamwork and coordination of the two major guilds were at their
best. Even without the members in the process of healing, they got
into a formation that quickly surrounded the boss.
And yet, lining up the numbers instead of colors was much harder
than one might imagine. The numbers only had to be arranged on
the one face that was lit up, but each blow moved three numbers
together. You had to be constantly aware of what numbers were on
which face and read several moves ahead of the present
arrangement.
Three minutes after combat resumed, my fears turned out to be
prescient. The rearranging of the numbers was not moving quickly.
303|P

They got the first four pretty smoothly, but then moving one caused
others to go out of alignment, and irritation began creeping into
Lind’s and Kibaou’s voices. If we whacked at it on a hunch, we’d
eventually get it, but the boss’s long arms were not to be taken
lightly. On top of the lasers, we now had to watch out for slams and
swipes from the arms, which steadily ground down the HP of the
combat members.
I wasn’t sure whether to leap into the front row, or if that would only
ruin the teamwork the six parties were using.
“…Okay, I’ve got it,” Asuna said abruptly. She shot me a glance.
“Kirito, I’m going to focus on giving orders. Can you handle the
boss?”
“Uh…yeah, of course.”
We gave each other a nod and moved simultaneously. Asuna leaped
in front of the boss and brandished her rapier. “Knock the lower
block to the right!”
“G-got it!” replied Hafner from the DKB. He hoisted his greatsword,
circled around the right side of the boss, and swiped sideways. Once
again, it did no damage, but the lower block did loudly rotate to the
right, as Asuna had instructed.
“Now knock the left blocks down!”
“Roger that!” replied the ALS’s Okotan, whose halberd shone. The
left column of blocks rotated downward.
At this, the Irrational Cube must have sensed a difference, because it
let out a discordant metal shriek. It swung two appendages made of
cubes, hurtling them down at Asuna. I promptly leaped forward and
activated the sword skill Vertical Arc. That was a two-strike combo of
downward and upward slices, and it knocked the two arms away.
Behind me, Asuna did not move a single step.

304|P

Once she focused solely on the numbers, Asuna’s orders were
frighteningly precise. With each block rotation, we could sense it
growing closer to completion.
But the boss could sense it, too, and it viciously, repeatedly went
after Asuna, who was not physically attacking it. I could knock the
arms away with sword skills, but the lasers were trickier. Each time
the aiming beams swept toward her, I picked her up and jumped out
of the way, but that got even harder when it did a delayed
combination of lasers and then physical attacks. The raid members
looked desperate, but if they tried attacking the boss to draw its
attention, the cube formation we’d been working so hard on would
be ruined, and if too many tried to surround her for protection, she
wouldn’t be able to see the numbers.
After yet another backward leap to escape a laser, my back struck a
hard, flat surface. Somehow, I’d been pushed against the wall
without realizing it. Two arms went into flat swiping motions from
my sides, right on cue. I could strike back one of them, but not both…
“I’ll get this one, Kirito!” said a voice. I shouted back, “Do it!” and
focused on the arm coming from the left. After I knocked it away
with Horizontal, I turned to my right and saw Theano thrusting the
other appendage away with her sword.
The strength of a hundred! I marveled silently, preparing for the next
attack. Meanwhile, Asuna continued giving orders, which the stout
warriors of the raid party faithfully carried out. Occasionally, they
made the wrong input, but undoing it was as easy as reversing the
last strike.
The damageless assault on the boss lasted for twenty-something
moves when Asuna’s clear voice called out, “Next one is the last!
Strike the center blocks down!”
“We got it!” “Yer on!”

305|P

Lind and Kibaou had no intention of letting the other have the honor
of the last blow. They charged from either side and slashed at the
center-block column with scimitar and longsword together.
Don’t push it, Lin-Kiba! I thought, but their aim was true. The center
column rumbled and rotated, revealing an order of three, five, seven.
The nine numbers on the front face of the boss shone so brightly, I
couldn’t look directly at them.
“We got it!” someone shouted, which was nearly drowned out by a
deafening rumble as the twenty-six cubes and three arms that made
up the Irrational Cube’s invincible armor crumbled away.
Countless shards melted into thin air, revealing that pitch-black cube,
a half meter to a side. In the middle of the side that faced us, we
could see a smaller item—the golden cube that Theano put in there.
This time, six new black arms extended from the black cube. They
made unpleasant high-frequency ringing sounds as they writhed
toward us.
“This is the real battle! Take it slow, an’ let’s figure out the patterns!”
Kibaou boomed. Both the ALS and DKB alike shouted “Yeah!” in
response.
It was a fierce battle indeed, but without its spotless armor, the
Irrational Cube didn’t have the defense to stand up to the elite
fighters of the advancement group, and more importantly, the level32 mother swordswoman, Theano. Its single HP bar fell slowly but
surely, past 50 percent, then 30…and in only seven minutes, it was
down below 10 percent.
Once everyone knew that the next good shot would end it, the
Irrational Cube let out a horrid shriek that sounded like its dying cry
and swung its six arms around wildly. All eight of its corners sent out
aiming beams.

306|P

“It’s going wild! Buckle down!” Lind commanded. Everyone went on
guard.
Within a moment, all the arms had been deflected, and all the lasers
dodged—and as though its batteries had run dry, the boss of the
sixth floor of Aincrad fell to the floor with a thud and ceased moving.
I relaxed my shoulders, thinking it was finally over…but there was
one stubborn pixel remaining on its HP bar.
“Wha…? Hey, what gives?! Izzit gonna self-destruct?!” Kibaou wailed.
I wondered the same thing. The raid members nearest to the landing
point sprang away and buckled down against an explosion…but
nothing happened. The boss, golden cube pointed my direction, was
silent.
That reminds me, Argo said something about this, I recalled.
Something about the reverse side of the cube…
At that moment, someone leaped forward toward the cube.
Whoever it was must have assumed there would be no self-destruct
and wanted to seize the last attack bonus. He was dressed in silver
and blue—the DKB. Lind would probably scold him later, but this
would, at last, be the end of the long, long battle…
“Huh…?!” Asuna gasped at my side, and I suddenly realized what she
was looking at.
It wasn’t a weapon the running player had in his hand. It was a
narrow piece of metal only a few centimeters long. A throwing
needle…no.
A key.
Time froze as the slender player crouched behind the back of the
cube and stuck the key into the keyhole where I couldn’t see it.
There was a faint click, and the golden cube slid out of the block,
tumbling to the floor.

307|P

“…!”
Theano let out a sharp breath and jumped forward. I raced after her.
The DKB member stood up. He circled around the block and scooped
the cube off the floor.
As she ran, Theano silently drew her rapier.
The DKB member raised the cube high with both hands and shouted.
“Bind!!”
There was a sound of slicing air, and a ring of golden light shot forth
from the cube, swallowing Theano and me as it passed us. My feet
suddenly stuck to the floor, and I tipped over spectacularly. I thought
I was going to tumble, but because my feet were stuck to the
ground, I only leaned at an extreme angle before bouncing back
upright. Theano was similarly rooted to the spot.
“…?!”
Stunned, I looked down to see translucent cubes growing out of the
floor to engulf my feet. On instinct, I checked my HP gauge. To the
right of the list of buffs, there was a new icon that hadn’t been there
a second before. It was an unfamiliar debuff: a human silhouette
within a square border.
“Why?! Why would you do this?!” I tried to yell, but then I belatedly
noticed that I had no voice. My entire body—legs, arms, even
fingers—was as heavy as lead.
Even in the midst of this emergency, a part of my mind was occupied
with a different question. Theano’s level was quite high but not
enough to obliterate the monsters of the tower in one hit. She must
have used the power of the golden cube to freeze, or Bind, the
ophidians.
Suddenly, I realized the boss chamber was filled with silence. I could
hear no voices, nor even the scraping of metal armor. Golden light
308|P

filled the vast, fifty-meter chamber from corner to corner. Every last
raid member must have been bound. I couldn’t move my right hand,
so I couldn’t even open my window. It was the ultimate
immobilization debuff, far beyond even the paralyzing poison.
The mystery DKB player slowly lowered the golden cube. He wore a
sallet helmet that covered the top of his head, leaving only the
mouth visible. The cursor over his head was orange, the criminal
color, certainly because of the debuff he’d just used. His name was
Buxum. I couldn’t recall ever seeing that name in a raid fight before.
Buxum’s mouth abruptly curled into a savage grin. The moment I saw
it, I knew.
He was with Morte and Joe. He was one of the black poncho’s
followers. At some point, he had infiltrated the DKB, waiting for this
very moment to strike.
If it were Morte, he’d laugh his dry laugh and spout some theatrical
lines at this point, but Buxum just leered and said nothing. Instead,
he transferred the large cube to one hand so he could draw his
longsword.
It was modestly made, but the wet gleam on the thin blade spoke of
stats that were no joking matter. The sword dangled from his hand
as he strode right toward Theano.
He’s going to kill her, I realized instantly.
Whether he was going to kill the entire raid party starting with
Theano, or just the NPC on her own, I wasn’t sure. But even if the
latter, I couldn’t passively watch it happen. Myia was behind me.
There was no way I could allow a ten-year-old girl to watch the
mother she’d just been reunited with be helplessly slaughtered. No
way at all…
“………!”

309|P

Stressed, silent air escaped my throat in place of a scream. I used
every bit of force I could summon. My avatar’s muscles quaked and
joints creaked. But the invisible shell that surrounded me did not
budge.
Buxum came to a stop before Theano. He lifted his sword and aimed
carefully at her heart, preparing to finish it all in a single blow.
Move.
Move move move movemovemovemovemove!!
It was the only word in my mind, the boundaries between the start
and end blurring into one pattern of sounds, losing meaning. A highpitched ringing sound rose from deep within me, spreading from
fingers to toes…
And then I saw it.
The Bind debuff icon was blinking. A new icon began to flicker next
to it. The silhouette of a person in a Zen meditative pose. It was…not
the Meditation buff. The design was the same, but there was now a
golden ring behind the silhouette.
–––––!!
I thought I heard something break.
My right foot pounced off the floor, instantly launching me over ten
meters forward. Drawn by invisible strings, I swung back the Sword
of Eventide. Buxum noticed my charge; his eyes widened through the
slits of the sallet helm. With remarkable reaction speed, he lifted his
sword and took a defensive position.
“Raaaaaahh!!” I bellowed, swinging my sword on a direct line at him.
Pkiiing! It almost sounded like a scream.
Buxum’s longsword split just above the hilt—and so did his left arm
behind it, nearly to the elbow.

310|P

Momentum carried me straight past both Theano and Buxum. As
soon as I landed, I spun 180 degrees. It was fast enough that I
normally would have tumbled, but it was as if inertia no longer
existed.
The twisted smile was gone from Buxum’s face, now that he had lost
his sword and arm. With his good arm, he lifted the cube again.
“Bi…”
But before the word was out of his mouth, I swung again.
Like the left arm, his right was severed at the elbow, and it vanished
pitifully on the spot. Without its support, the golden cube thudded to
the floor.
Even for an enemy, I had to admire the quickness with which Buxum
reacted after losing both arms. He promptly spun around and raced
with tremendous speed for the exit.
“Oh, no, you don’t!” I yelled, but the strength had gone out of my
legs, and I fell to my knee right on the spot. The icon that resembled
the Meditation buff blinked and went away.
I managed to get to my feet, but by that point, Buxum was already at
the door. He slammed into it to push it open and vanished into the
hallway. There was no way I could catch up to him at that speed.
A few seconds later, one of the HP bars from Team F on the left side
of my view neatly disappeared. Struggling against the stifling weight
that seemed to be the physical cost of the mystery buff, I surveyed
the boss chamber. Theano, Asuna, Argo, Myia, and all the other raid
members were still under the effect of the binding spell. Surely it
wasn’t permanent, but how to undo the paralysis? The answer to
that was obvious, however.

311|P

I sheathed my sword and scooped the cube up off the ground, then
walked over toward the black block. There was still the one pixel of
health on the bar hanging in the air over it.
I knelt in front of the boss and gazed at the golden cube, in my hands
at last. This object had changed the lives of many people. Cylon,
Theano, Myia, Terro the gardener, and probably Pithagrus, too. Now
it was time for it to be destroyed.
I stuck the cube against the hole in the block and pushed, and it
smoothly slid inside on its own. I waited until the surface was sheer
to draw my sword again.
Using the pommel, rather than the well-worn blade edge, I struck the
top of the black cube.
That was enough. Cracks spread from the spot, and blue light spilled
out from within. At that moment, the Irrational Cube, boss of the
sixth floor of Aincrad, was out of HP, and it crumbled into pieces,
including the golden cube within it. Only the steel key escaped that
fate. It tumbled lightly to the floor.
I plopped down on the seat of my pants as the message proclaiming
the LAST ATTACK bonus appeared overhead.
A moment later, the raid members were released from their negative
status, and an uproar promptly arose. Some people collapsed to the
ground, others flipped over, and Kibaou turned on Lind.
The boss chamber was now light, as though waking from a
nightmare, and full of lively sound. I looked up when I heard
footsteps approaching and saw Theano coming over.
It wasn’t just her. Asuna, Myia, and Argo were all rushing toward me.
Enveloped in an irresistible blanket of fatigue, I could do nothing
more than lift my right hand to wave at my beloved companions.

312|P

“WHEW…WE FINALLY MADE IT BACK…”
Asuna stretched luxuriously as I opened my menu window. But I
couldn’t even be bothered to keep my hand lifted, and so I let it
dangle. It was 12:40 AM on January 5.
I waved my left hand to dispel the window and surveyed my
surroundings.
Despite it still being early in the night by online gamer standards, the
teleport square of Stachion, main town of the sixth floor, was nearly
devoid of people. There were two reasons, by my reckoning: The
gate on the seventh floor had been activated, so the tourists were up
above, and all the sudoku puzzles that had filled the square were
completely gone now.
There was little lingering affection for the puzzles in me, but Theano,
who stood on the far side of Asuna, looked out at the blank tiles with
a reflective expression. Resting on her back was Myia’s adorable
sleeping face, with the gas mask sitting atop her head.
Only two hours had passed since the defeat of the Irrational Cube,
the sixth-floor boss, and in that time, the trek back through the
desert of the fifth area, the passage over Lake Talpha, and the
shortcut through the woods of the first area had taken…no time at
all, actually. Instead, we climbed the spiral stairs that descended
from the ceiling of the boss chamber up to the seventh floor, walked
to the main town there, activated the teleporter, and took it back
here.
That made Myia and Theano, as far as I was aware, the first quest
NPCs to use a teleport gate to travel between floors. In fact, I was
even worried that the two might not make it through and would
simply be stuck on the seventh floor, but the SAO system was more

313|P

generous than I imagined. Though there was always the chance, like
Liten’s infinite ore bug, that it would be patched out later.
As for Theano, she had no particular interest in the magical gateway
she’d walked through. Instead, she stared at the square and the
town in the distance in silence. Eventually, she walked over to Asuna
and me and gave us a bow, with Myia still being carried on her back.
“…Kirito, Asuna, you have truly saved me…Not only did you keep
Myia safe, but I am certain that I would not have been able to defeat
that guardian beast and destroy the golden cube on my own.”
Um, you know Myia’s a higher level than us, right? I wanted to ask
her but wisely refrained. Instead, I shook my head and said,
“Please…if you and Myia hadn’t solved the puzzles on the door, we
would have been trapped inside the chamber and died there.”
“He’s right,” added Asuna. “I think I’m pretty good at those puzzles,
but I could never manage one in ten seconds.”
Theano smiled weakly. She readjusted her sleeping daughter’s
position and turned around to view the rising stair-step layout of
Stachion. At the end of the main street, the lord’s mansion shone in
the moonlight. There was no light in the windows, making its lack of
a resident clear.
“Um…what’s going to happen to the mansion—er, to the entire
town?” I asked. I couldn’t help it.
In a sense, the town in an RPG was operated by the game system,
not by the mayor who lived there, so Cylon’s absence shouldn’t
actually have any effect on the town itself. But I couldn’t miss the
indescribable sadness in Theano’s face as she stared up at the
mansion, which prompted my question.
Without turning back to us, she whispered, “I think…nothing will
change, except for the puzzles being gone. It was Lord Pithagrus who
built up Stachion and saw to its management. He challenged that
314|P

fearsome guardian beast alone, extracted the golden cube, and used
its powers of Break—reducing all stone and plant matter to cubes—
and Bind—to stick those cubes together with unbreakable force—to
build this great settlement…”
“What…? So Bind was supposed to stick the cubes together?” Asuna
asked, startled.
The lady swordfighter looked back and nodded. “That is its intended
use. But when a living thing is within its radius, that being will be
bound as well. According to Lord Pithagrus, the golden cube was a
prototype tool of war fashioned by the mages of the Alliance of the
Nine that once existed in the lost lands.”
“…”
I looked at Asuna. Kizmel told us the story of Aincrad’s creation
myth, the Great Separation, but I assumed it was just the elven
legend. Who was this Pithagrus guy anyway? I wondered, well after
the fact, but I wasn’t in the mood to dig up the “Curse of Stachion”
quest now that we’d finished it. There were plenty of other things to
worry about.
For example, the fact that the fallen elf Kysarah had stolen the four
sacred keys we collected. And even worse, the mysterious Buxum,
who used the golden cube to immobilize us all in the boss chamber
and tried to kill Theano at the very least—and possibly the rest of the
raid party as well. The ALS and DKB were going to hold an emergency
meeting in that chamber, but Asuna and I didn’t want Theano and
Myia to hear about our death-game predicament, and so we
escorted them directly to the seventh floor. The situation couldn’t be
ignored, however, so I knew that soon I would need to gather the
principal members of both guilds and explain everything I knew
about the man in the black poncho and his cohorts. After they had
witnessed Buxum’s deeds for themselves, it shouldn’t be hard to
convince them that there was a gang of PKers on the loose.
315|P

“Ten years it has been since Lord Pithagrus died…” Theano said,
picking up where she left off. I had to switch gears to focus on her
story. “In that ten years, the mysterious power that protected the
cube seeped into the town, bit by bit, growing puzzles on every door
in Stachion, just like in the Pillar of the Heavens. I do not know how
Lord Pithagrus was holding the power of the cube back, but I always
hoped to work with Cylon to discover it, so that we could remove the
puzzles that tormented the townsfolk. But…”
She hesitated, darkness blotting her features. In a quieter voice, she
continued, “But I could not forgive Cylon for killing Lord Pithagrus in
that fit of anger. We had promised to share our future
together…which is why I wanted him to admit his sin, to repent, and
think about what one must do to truly become the town lord. For ten
long years, I waited for the day he would come to visit me…”
As I watched her shake her head, I felt a frequent question come to
mind, and without really thinking, I gave voice to it.
“Um, Theano…what was it about Cylon that made you—?”
Asuna elbowed me in the side, which made me realize I’d been
asking a potentially rude question. But Theano just smiled wistfully
and looked somewhere far off.
“Ever since childhood, he was weak-willed, suspicious, yet proud,
and always fighting with the other children…”
Since childhood? They were childhood friends? I wondered, then
realized it had to be true. The biggest city on the sixth floor was only
six hundred meters north to south and half as wide. Every single
child of the same generation would have known one another.
“But really, he was very kind. From early on, it had been arranged for
me to serve at Lord Pithagrus’s mansion. I was worried, but in order
to cheer me up, he said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll pass Lord Pithagrus’s test
and become his apprentice. Just hang in there.’ He kept his word and
316|P

dreamed that eventually he would become the next lord of the town,
marry me, and we would live in that mansion together. But…when
he learned that he would not be chosen, the shock and
disappointment must have been great…”
“…Huh? But…” I stammered, glancing briefly at Asuna. “I thought
Pithagrus was going to choose you to be the next master of the
town. So Cylon shouldn’t have been quite so devastated…”
Theano looked bewildered for a moment, then shook her head
rapidly. Over her shoulder, Myia murmured in her sleep, and her
mother gently rocked her back to a peaceful state. Then she focused
on us again and gave another shake of her head.
“No…Lord Pithagrus did teach me, a servant, all about puzzles, but
that was more of a game to him. He did not need an heir. Lord
Pithagrus was immortal; he had lived for centuries before the town
of Stachion was ever built.”
“Wh…what?!” I yelped, clamping my mouth shut. Once I was sure
that Myia hadn’t woken up, I resumed in a much quieter voice,
“He…he couldn’t die…?”
I was beginning to wonder if perhaps Pithagrus hadn’t been
murdered but was still alive out there somewhere, but Theano made
a negative gesture.
“No, I suppose I should say he had everlasting life. He couldn’t die of
old age. When I came to the mansion, he was already a wizened old
man with white hair, but the butler, who was the eldest of all the
servants, claimed that Pithagrus already looked that way when he
was a boy, too.”
“…So…when Cylon learned the truth…” Asuna mumbled, and Theano
nodded.
“He discovered that Lord Pithagrus would not die of old age, and
there would be no handing down of the position…it was the anger,
317|P

disappointment, and perhaps even fear he felt that drove him to that
terrible act. Much like this town itself, Lord Pithagrus was a man
unbound by human reason…”
Theano stopped there, a lucid gaze in her eyes, and I sensed that I
did not need to pry any further about Cylon. Instead, I felt in my belt
pouch for the item I picked up at the end of the boss fight—a dull
metal key.
“Um…you should have this, Theano,” I said, handing it over. She
looked at it for a moment before accepting it. Holding up the key
that was once two in the moonlight, she said, “So this key was always
meant to be one…Lord Pithagrus gave Cylon and me those keys in
the last days of our eighteenth year, but he did not say what they
were for. I could never have guessed that they made the key to
remove the cube from the guardian beast’s body…Why would he
give such a thing to us…?”
Neither Asuna nor I had the answer to that question.
At the end of the “Curse of Stachion” quest in the beta, the ghost of
Pithagrus bestowed his forgiveness upon Cylon for killing him, told
him to work with Theano to protect the town, and vanished. In other
words, the Pithagrus of the beta named Cylon and Theano together
as his successors.
I wondered if perhaps the same thing would be true of this immortal
version of Pithagrus, but I couldn’t bring that up.
Instead, Asuna took it upon herself to say, “I am sure that he loved
you—and Cylon.”
Without a word, Theano looked at the distant mansion again. I felt as
though a little glimmer of light may have appeared on the side of her
face, but when she turned back to us again after a good long while,
all I saw was the same little smile.
“…You might be right.”
318|P

Theano placed the key inside the collar of her armor, then reached
back to stroke her sleeping daughter’s head.
She demanded that we come and visit again someday, before taking
her daughter out of the square. When their HP bars vanished, a
system message appeared in the center of my vision, telling me that
a quest had been completed.
Unlike in the beta, we got no col or items, but there were more than
enough experience points to make up for it, and both Asuna and I
received the level-up effect at the same time. I was level 22 now, and
Asuna level 21, but I wasn’t in the mood for my usual “Yahoo!” leap.
We shared a look, said “Congrats” in unison, and shook hands.
That seemed to help compose Asuna’s feelings for the time being,
and she seemed more like herself when she asked, “So…what now?
Do we go back to the seventh floor?”
“I’m shot.”
“…Huh?”
“My energy gauge is completely shot. In about three minutes, I’m
going to pass out and sleep for ten hours straight.”
That earned me one of Asuna’s usual annoyed looks. She sighed.
“That’s because you were wandering out and about last night.
Oh…we need to go back to Castle Galey, too. That old man needs an
apology for the keys.”
“You’re right…but for now, I need to sleep…”
“Then let’s stay at an inn here tonight. Will the Pegasus Hoof do?”
“As long as there’s a blanket and pillow, I don’t care…”
Asuna shook her head again, then grabbed my left hand and started
walking. She pulled me to a large inn just on the north side of the
open square, and we walked up to the check-in counter. I was
319|P

halfway asleep as I heard her order the third-floor suite, after which
she pulled me up the stairs.
When we approached the door at the very end of the long hallway,
Asuna let out a faint murmur. I lifted heavy lids to see that my
partner was staring at a niche in the wall next to the door.
It reminded me that this was the room where we talked with the
DKB members about the guild flag on the day we arrived at the sixth
floor. Lind and Shivata had struggled with the cast-metal puzzle set
into the niche, but now it was gone.
Asuna reached out and brushed the empty alcove with her fingers.
Then she pulled them back and turned the doorknob. It made a little
click, and the door swung open.
We shared a look, then grinned and entered the room.
The suite room of the Pegasus Hoof was as gorgeous as I
remembered. There was a four-seat table and a sofa set in the rather
deep living room, with doors to separate bedrooms on either side
wall. Asuna asked me which room I wanted. I could’ve honestly just
slept on the couch, but I knew she’d snap at me, so I said, “The left
one…”
“Then I’ll take the right. Good night…and remember to unequip your
gear before you fall into bed.”
“Hyep…goo-nye…”
I crossed the living room diagonally, essentially on autopilot at this
point, and turned the knob of the door on the left wall. Inside the
dark bedroom, I opened my window and tapped the UNDO
EQUIPMENT button twice on feel alone. Now in just my underwear, I
flopped face-first onto the bed.

320|P

As I felt my weight sinking into the soft comforter, I reminded myself
that the night was cold, and I needed to get under the covers, but my
body wouldn’t listen.
When I was soloing on the first floor, it wasn’t uncommon for me to
level grind for twenty-four hours at a time once I spotted a good
hunting location. But today’s fatigue was far beyond any of that. This
hadn’t been a monotonous hunting session, where memorizing
repetitive combat patterns allowed my mind to go empty for long
stretches of time. Today I had racked my brain continuously to adapt
to varied situations and threats that popped up one after the other.
But the same should have gone for Asuna, too. Was she in better
spirits because she was used to using her brain more often than me?
If that was the case, then maybe I needed to learn how to think
smarter, if I wanted to continue protecting her. As her temporary
partner, of…course…
My thoughts expanded, sinking my conscious mind below the depths
into infinite darkness…
“I got it! Kirito, I got it!”
The door to my bedroom flew open, and an obnoxiously loud cry of
triumph echoed throughout the room. The room lit up, and through
eyelids that rose only a fraction of a centimeter, I saw Asuna in her
nightwear leap inside.
“…Y-you got what…?”
“The number! And more than just that, but the number!” she
exclaimed, pounding her hands onto the side of the bed across from
where I was lying. I wanted to tell her to save it for tomorrow, but
she was too fired up for that, so I managed to roll onto my side and
ask, “What number…?”
Asuna leaned over closer, her hazel-brown eyes glittering with
excitement. “The door to Pithagrus’s secret home in Suribus!
321|P

Remember the six-digit number on the dial lock? It was driving me
crazy that I couldn’t figure out what it meant!”
Now that she mentioned it, when I told her the code to undo the
lock, she had said something to that effect. That it was familiar to her
somehow…
“What was it…six, two, eight, four, nine, six…?” I said, wringing the
numbers loose from memory.
She nodded twice. “That’s right. That’s not just a random string of
numbers. They’re the first three perfect numbers.”
“…P-perfect numbers…?”
It sounded like something I might’ve learned about in school.
Curiosity drove sleep away just enough for me to prop up my head
with my left arm. “What’s so perfect about them?”
“A perfect number is defined as an integer that is equal to the sum of
its proper divisors. See, the factors of six are one, two, and three,
right? If you add them up, they make six. And the factors of twentyeight are one, two, four, seven, and fourteen…which add up to
twenty-eight. And four hundred ninety-six is the next one.”
“Ohhh…I see…”
It was an interesting discovery but didn’t seem like more than a
curiosity. It just meant that whoever wrote the story for the “Curse
of Stachion” quest picked out the first three perfect numbers on a
whim for that lock.
But Asuna already knew what I was thinking. “That’s not all of it! So,
um…when you did the beta, you saw the cursor for the ghost of
Pithagrus, right?”
“Y-yeah, I did.”
“What was his name? How was his name spelled?”

322|P

“Uh…actually, I think it was just a generic title like Restless Soul,
without an individual name attached to it…”
“Ah. So they were hiding it, then,” she replied seriously. Then,
without warning, Asuna hopped onto the bed. She rolled onto her
side next to me and opened her window so I could see. Without
showing any recognition of how stunned I was, she went to the
MESSAGES tab and used a blank message field as a notepad to type
in the Western alphabet.
“You see, I think the proper spelling of Pithagrus’s name is probably
this. We just never saw it written down this way, only heard it
spoken.”
“O-okay…?”
I laid my head back down on the pillow to see the window, which
contained the following string of letters.
PYTHAGORAS.
“P…Pie…tha…What? Is that how his name is supposed to be
spelled?”
“Yes, going by the English spelling. But this might not ring a bell for
you yet. You’d be much more familiar with the Japanese
pronunciation…or proper Greek.”
“The Japanese pronunciation…?”
Truly confused now, I looked at the window again. I tried to sound
out the letters in the way that foreign sounds were represented in
Japanese.
“Pi…sa…goras? Pisa…Wait, no…should it be a T? Pitagoras?! Wait, is
this the famous—?!”
Ninety percent of my sleepiness was gone, shot through with
adrenaline.

323|P

I wasn’t the most attuned student at school, but even I knew this
name. In the second semester of my second year of middle school,
just before I got trapped in SAO, I had learned about Pythagoras, the
ancient Greek mathematician whose name was associated with the
theorem about the sides of a right triangle. He was the founder of
some kind of math club named after himself, too, and discovered a
whole bunch of mathematical properties and concepts. So he would
have been the one who named them “perfect numbers.”
“…So why didn’t they just make it clear that he was Pythagoras from
the start…?” I grumbled, earning a chuckle from Asuna.
“They probably wanted to put a little distance between the character
and the historical figure, and that’s why they hid the alphabetical
spelling. He would’ve only been the model for the character, after
all…”
“Ah…Was the real Pythagoras good at solving puzzles, too?”
“No, I’ve never heard anything to that effect. And he’s never been
called the king of puzzles or whatever. Although, I do think his focus
on the harmony and integrity of numbers bears some connection to
the concept of puzzles.”
“Uh-huh…”
I rolled onto my back and thought back dully on the events of the
past four days.
“And the real Pythagoras was killed by his own follower,” Asuna
muttered.
“Huh…he was…?”
“Technically, it was a person who wanted to join his scholastic order,
whom Pythagoras rejected. So the man whipped up the people of
the town to attack the order out of revenge…Although, I don’t
remember if his name was Cylon or not…”

324|P

“Whipped them up…” I repeated, thinking not of the quest but of the
man in the black poncho and his friends. The man named Buxum
who infiltrated the DKB and tried to steal the golden cube somehow
knew where to use the iron key, when even Theano didn’t. And
beyond that, he even knew how to utilize the terrible Bind powers of
the cube.
How did Buxum get the iron key that Kysarah the fallen elf stole from
Myia and me? And how did Buxum and the black-poncho man
arrange their relationship with the Fallen in the first place?
The curse quest was over, and we beat the boss of the sixth floor
without any casualties, but the mysteries and unaddressed problems
were everywhere. If I wanted to solve those issues, and ensure that I
could protect Asuna from harm, I had to be stronger. Strong enough
to fight Kysarah one-on-one.
“Oh, right, Kirito.”
The mention of my name caused my half-closed eyelids to rise again.
Asuna sat up and looked straight down at me.
“Wh-what…?”
“Let me see your eyes.”
“H-huh…?” I blinked, unsure of what my partner wanted to do.
To my surprise, she said, “In the boss chamber, when you broke
through the Bind, I felt like your eyes were shining gold.”
“What…really? They were? Are they now?”
“No, they’re black.”
“Oh…”
Relieved, I relaxed and let my gaze lock with Asuna’s hazel-brown
eyes. Instantly, I felt something leaving my body and knew that I was
really at the limit of my wakefulness now.
325|P

Asuna’s little smile melted into darkness, and through fading wits, I
heard her faint whisper:
“Good night, Kirito.”
“Good night, Asuna,” I said, although I couldn’t be sure if it ever left
my lips.
(End)

326|P

Thank you for reading Sword Art Online Progressive 6, “Canon of the
Golden Rule (End).”
It feels like this one turned out half as long as the first part again, but
that’s probably just my imagination. Anyway, it scares me to think
that, in the planning stage, I thought I could tell a story of this length
in one book…I honestly have no idea how it got this long! But that
would be the boring version of my thoughts on this story, so instead,
I’ll jot down some loose reflections.
As symbolized by masterpieces like Dragon Quest and EverQuest, the
concepts of RPG and quest are inseparable. You might say the quest
itself is the heart and soul of the RPG. And the format of singleplayer RPGs always contains your main quest and your subquests.
But when it comes to MMORPGs, I’ve always felt that the nature of
the quest becomes unstable and uncomfortable. As Kirito himself has
opined a number of times in the story, you have the same events
happening for every player that plays them, the same stories playing
out, and this involves some degree of warping the experience—and
forcing the narrative to fit the shared world. I’ve always understood
that this was unavoidable but felt it wasn’t the ideal way to do
things. If there’s one quest out there, shouldn’t only one player be
able to complete it?
I understand that’s practically impossible, of course. But what if,
instead of a human scenario writer and programmer, an AI acted like
the GM of a tabletop RPG, generating infinite quests and adjusting
the story to fit the characters’ actions? Couldn’t the ideal of a story
“just for you” become a reality that way? This was a thought I
entertained as I wrote this book. I think I managed to stick to my idea
of having Kirito and Asuna’s quest go further and further from the
baseline scenario due to the interference of PKers and NPCs, but
327|P

next I want to write a player-centric story! In a single volume this
time!
If I have any regrets, it’s that I wasn’t able to use the puzzle theme of
the sixth floor more effectively. Originally, I wanted to provide a
number of puzzles throughout the story for you readers to tackle,
but I didn’t like the idea of it turning into the kind of book where the
reader can choose one of multiple branching paths. If Bandai Namco
ever makes SAO into a real VRMMORPG, I’m going to force them to
put lots of puzzles in the sixth floor (laughs).
Finally, my acknowledgments…To my editors, Miki and Adachi, and
my illustrator, abec, for really pushing the schedule with my
ballooning page count, I offer my sincerest apologies and gratitude!
See you on floor seven in Volume 7!
