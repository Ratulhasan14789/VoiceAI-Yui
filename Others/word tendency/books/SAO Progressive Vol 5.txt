“PAH-CHOO!”
I spun around to ascertain the nature of the odd sound behind
my back.
The fencer who was my temporary partner had her hands over
her nose. A few seconds later, she arched her back and loosed
another “Pah-choo!”
“…Was that a sneeze, or are you saying you want patchouli for
your bath tonight?” I quipped, earning myself a glare.
“I don’t like patchouli.”
“What about pumpkin spice?”
“Nope.”
“Maybe parsnip?”
“Nope…Hey, that’s not even a thing!” she snapped, bringing the
joke full circle. Asuna, the level-18 swordswoman, sighed. “It was
a sneeze…I think. I’m not sure.”
“Huh? Wh-what does that mean? Shouldn’t you be able to tell if
you sneezed or not…?” I wondered, seriously this time. I came to a
stop in the middle of the path.
Just an hour or two ago, the central street of Karluin, the main
town of the fifth floor of Aincrad, had been packed with people,
but now it was completely empty. The countdown party with
fireworks to celebrate the arrival of the year 2023 was over, and
the players had cleared out, returning to their inn rooms—or
back to the wilderness to hunt.
Asuna and I watched the fireworks from the old castle ruins
outside town and waited for the area to grow quiet before we left.
This was because we’d had a dangerous, unexpected encounter in
the ruins. Even with my excellent Search skill, it would be harder
to detect someone trailing us in a crowd.
I casually checked behind me as I waited for Asuna to reply. To
my surprise, she had a very rational response: “Sneezes are
involuntary bodily functions designed to either raise your body
temperature when it’s cold or expel a foreign object from the
nasal cavity, right? Neither are necessary for a player avatar to
do.”
“Oh. Well, I guess…that’s a good point…”

14|P

“So if the SAO system is artificially reproducing some kind of
sneezing function, I’m not certain that can be called a ‘real’
sneeze…That’s my point.”
“I see…” I murmured, impressed. Then my own nose started to
tickle. It was either the chill or the repetition of the word sneeze
that was making me conscious of it. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it
any longer.
“Broosh!” I exploded.
Asuna grinned smugly at me. “What’s that? Are you saying you
want bruschetta for breakfast tomorrow?”
“…What’s bruschetta?”
“It’s a kind of Italian finger food.”
“That actually sounds kind of good,” I murmured, imagining
what this bruschetta might look like and unconsciously tugging
the collar of my coat tighter before I realized what I was doing.
“Hey…is it just me or is it kinda cold here?”
“…Yes, it’s rather chilly…”
Asuna wore a hooded wool cape, but it was over a miniskirt
that didn’t seem to defend much against the elements. A man who
was smooth and considerate would put his own coat on her
without saying a word, but as a loser gamer and shut-in, I wasn’t
equipped with any skills that I couldn’t earn in a video game.
Fortunately, before I said or did anything to embarrass myself,
Asuna opened her menu and adjusted her equipment mannequin.
Light covered the pale legs exposed by her leather battle skirt,
then faded into white tights.
There shouldn’t be any artificial fibers in this world, given the
setting, but somehow, the skintight material seemed to shine in
the light—I couldn’t help but stare. Before, she would’ve
retaliated with a cold look, sharp words, and perhaps even some
kind of physical attack—but this time, Asuna just cleared her
throat and looked up at the bottom of the floor above, visible in
the dark.
“…Well, it is the beginning of the year, so you would expect it to
be cold…and yet, the fourth floor was quite warm when we were
down there recently. How does Aincrad handle the seasons of the
year?”
15|P

“Um…it was August in the beta test, but even though the sun
felt hot at midday, it wasn’t, like, unpleasantly hot. And it was
nothing like the suffocating muggy heat of midsummer in real
life.”
“Hmm…I suppose if it were really that hot, nobody would be
able to bother with full plate armor and the like.”
“Good point. Makes me wonder what those old European
knights did during the summer…”
“The Knights Templar of the Kingdom of Jerusalem lost to
Saladin’s forces because the heat sapped their strength.”
“Ah…I see.”
As usual, Asuna had plenty of facts to back herself up. I started
getting the nasty feeling that she might eventually learn more
about Aincrad than even I knew, so I quickly brought us back to
the matter at hand:
“The point is…Aincrad does model the seasons to an extent, but
I don’t think it actually simulates heat and cold to a level that is
uncomfortable. I mean, this isn’t nearly as bad as the midwinter
weather we’d be feeling in the real world, right?”
“Even dressed like this, the worst it does is make me sneeze.”
“But there are exceptions. I seem to remember reading about
floors that are winter or summer all year round…according to a
magazine article or something…”
“Hmm…”
Asuna glanced up once more, then wondered, “You didn’t find
this floor of eternal summer during the beta test?”
“Well, it was summer at the time…but I do remember a beach
on the south side of floor seven. It had white sand, coconut trees,
and a bunch of players enjoying their summer vacation in
swimsuits.”
“The way you say that makes me assume you didn’t take part,”
she noted insightfully.
“Well, a guy celebrating his vacation all alone is kinda sad,
right?” I admitted. “It’s fine. I was focused on getting through the
game.”

16|P

This desperate excuse made Asuna grin enough to forget the
cold. She patted me on the back. “South side of the seventh floor?
I’ll remember that. If it really is an area of eternal summer…”
“…Then?”
“Mmm. I think I’ll keep it under wraps until then. Let’s get
going to the next main town. The sixth floor starts in earnest
tomorrow…er, today.”
The fencer walked off at a brisk pace, and I had to rush to catch
up, feeling skeptical. It had been more than a month since our
temporary partnership began, and I still couldn’t tell what she
was thinking most of the time.
But I guess that’s part of her charm, I thought, which was
uncharacteristic of me. I shook my head, and my nostrils began
itching again. It was harmless enough in the safety of town, but if I
sneezed in a dungeon while trying to hide, the consequences
could be disastrous. I’d have to study how to suppress the urge.
I tried holding my nose, then my breath, but neither worked.
Eventually, my itchiness meter reached its peak.
“Vah-kesh!”
Asuna stopped and turned around to look at me with a 60
percent annoyed glare and 40 percent enigmatic smile.
“Are you that excited about summer vacation?” she asked.
“N-no, I…”
“Then we’d better get through the sixth floor as quickly as we
can.”
“I’m telling you, it’s not like that!”
But no matter how much I protested, the smirk never left the
fencer’s face. In the end, I wasn’t even sure if I really wanted the
seventh floor to be an everlasting summer paradise or not.

17|P

1
EVEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TELEPORT GATE, the air was
still chilly.
Unlike Karluin, the fifth floor’s main town that existed in the
ruins of an ancient city, Stachion was a pristinely built town on
the sixth floor. The main material of construction was a shiny gray
rock like polished granite, and every single structure was made of
blocks exactly the same size in a grid pattern, about eight inches
to a side—meaning that everything was straight lines and angles.
The effect was so striking that when I first visited this place in the
beta test, my reaction was—well, exactly the same as Asuna’s
now:
“Ooh…It’s so blocky…”
“Well, we are trapped in a video game,” I replied, the standard
joke in Stachion. It earned me a piercing, cold glare that lowered
my body temperature even further.
I tugged the collar of my coat up, but it did nothing to keep the
chill away. It was still much better than actual winter, but one of
the more annoying parts of the virtual world was that once you
noticed it was warm or cold, the only way to stop feeling it
required some kind of in-game logic.
It was three o’clock in the morning, January 1, 2023.
The frontline population’s New Year’s enthusiasm had burned
itself out with the fireworks show, and hardly a soul could be
found in the teleport gate square of Stachion. A dry north wind
blew through the empty space, which was about fifty yards to a
side. I figured it would be cold for Asuna and her miniskirt, but
between the fleece-lined cape and tights, she seemed to be
protected enough.
Or perhaps the chill I’m feeling now is more than just the
NerveGear’s artificial sensations…

18|P

In the old castle ruins to the east of Karluin, where Asuna and I
were going to watch the fireworks show, I’d left to get food and
run straight into an attack by a mysterious figure in a black
poncho. The castle was within the protective limits of the town, of
course, so his plan had been to cleverly trick me into thinking I
was still inside the anti-criminal code zone while he lured me into
the castle’s basement, which was actually outside the safe area.
The man in the black poncho had snuck up right behind me,
despite my proficiency in the Search skill, pointed a knife to my
back, and whispered, “It’s showtime.” The coldness of that voice
would not leave my ears…The way it richly lilted as though in
song—and yet alien in how it betrayed no discernable emotion.
I was nearly too late to detect his bluff. I rattled off a series of
sword skills within the safe zone, hoping to push him into a
simulated stunned state, but he used an unfamiliar smoke screen
item to escape. I rushed back to the room where I’d left Asuna and
was so relieved to see my temporary partner safe that I hugged
her—earning me a vicious hook to the right flank. But that hadn’t
solved the underlying problem.
My guess was that the man in the black poncho was the boss of
Morte, the axman who had tried to kill me in a duel. The leader of
the PK group agitators who had tempted the Legend Braves into
their equipment-upgrading scam and who’d tried to get the
Dragon Knights Brigade (DKB) and Aincrad Liberation Squad
(ALS) to go to war against each other.
Thanks to me and Asuna intervening, neither of those incidents
developed into disaster. That was why the man in the black
poncho came to eliminate me directly, I assumed—but they
weren’t going to give up from a single failed attempt. I’d have to
watch out for danger at all times from now on.
And there was one even larger problem:
There was a high possibility that they’d go after Asuna, too.
That, above all else, I had to prevent, and yet, I still hadn’t told her
about the attack I’d just suffered.
I wasn’t going to keep it a secret, of course. By tonight’s inn
stay at the latest, I’d tell her all about the man in detail and give
her another primer on the basic tenets of PvP combat. But all I
19|P

could grapple with at the moment was what had happened right
after we ascended to the fifth floor.
It was Asuna who’d asked for a lesson in player-versus-player
battle—whether you called it PvP or dueling or whatever. After
the fight against Morte on the fourth floor, I immediately
recognized the importance of this lesson, so in an empty corner of
the ruins, we engaged in a proper duel.
But once we actually faced each other with swords up, she
couldn’t move. Instead, she tearfully lowered her blade and said
she didn’t want to do it.
It wasn’t that she had no talent for PvP. When one of the PKers
had nearly taken her Chivalric Rapier in the ruins dungeon of the
fifth floor, the way she utilized a looting monster to get it back
was brilliant work. Once that imagination of hers had both
knowledge and experience to bolster it, she’d be able to put her
already considerable talent to use in the arena of man-to-man
combat.
But under the current rules of SAO, where dying in-game
meant dying in real life, a player duel was therefore a fight to the
death. If both sides were evenly matched, the winner would be
whoever had less hesitation about taking the other’s life. Or in
other words, without that level of cruelty, any potential victory in
a close fight was likely to result in a loss.
If I was going to teach Asuna how to fight another player, it
was more important that she learned that cold rationality than
any fiddly mechanical techniques I might teach her. I’d never
killed another player myself, of course, but if it was necessary to
protect myself or my partner, I believed I could do it. Or phrased
another way, I wasn’t a good enough person at heart to hesitate in
the heat of the moment.
But Asuna was different. She was much more kindhearted than
me—with an upright and honest soul. I didn’t want to tell her that
she should be cold and cruel and ready to kill…
“…Hey, Kirito.” I looked up and saw my partner right in front of
me, concerned. “Why did you clam up all of a sudden? You aren’t
hungry already, are you?”
“N-no, that’s not it…”
20|P

“Then can I ask my first question of the sixth floor?”
“G-go right ahead,” I prompted. We’d been in the middle of the
tenth floor when the beta test ended, so including this floor, there
were only four and a half left where I could actually answer
Asuna’s questions. After all that’s happened, we’re already on the
sixth floor, I marveled.
Then the fencer asked simply, “What’s this?”
“Eh?”
Asuna pointed down at our feet. I followed her slender index
finger to one of the gray tiles that paved the teleport square. Like
the blocks that made up the buildings, it was just ordinary stone
about eight inches to a side, but one in every four or so tiles had
an Arabic numeral from one to nine on it.
“Ahh…yes, these…” I took two steps back and pointed down,
just like she did. “See how the line between them is thicker here?”
“You’re right…”
“This thicker line is where the tiles are split into nine-by-nine
grids of eighty-one tiles total. Does this look familiar to you?”
“Nine by nine…” Asuna mumbled. She blinked three times, then
looked up and grinned. “Ohhh, I get it. This is a sudoku puzzle! I
was pretty good at them. Interesting, so the tiles of the square
make a puzz…le…”
She trailed off as she got another look around the teleport
square. If you ignored the actual teleport gate in the middle, the
entire square, fifty yards to a side, was covered in these tiles. And
those sudoku puzzles with their number hints ran from end to
end.
“…How many of these puzzles are there?”
“If it hasn’t changed from the beta, there are twenty-seven
rows and columns of these eighty-one-tile sets. Since the exact
middle one is taken up by the gate, that means it’s twenty-seven
squared, minus one. Which equals seven hundred twenty-eight.”
“Seven hun—” Asuna gasped quietly. She looked away from the
numbers at her feet. “For a moment, I was interested in solving
them all. I am no longer interested.”
“A wise decision,” I said with a sage tone channeling that of any
given village elder NPC. “During the beta test, those youngsters
21|P

who fell prey to the lures of sudoku and gave up on helping us
advance the game were called sudokers out of respect…”
“That’s an even sadder nickname than the ‘hoarders’ who got
addicted to finding coins in the ruins. But given how many of
these puzzles there are, does that mean there’s some mammoth
reward if you solve them all?”
“You’d think so,” I said, normally this time. “I was under that
assumption during the beta, and the sudokers certainly believed
it. But the nasty part about this is…all the hint numbers get
switched up at midnight every night.”
“What?! So you’re saying…if you wanted to solve the whole
batch, you’d have to do seven hundred twenty-eight sudoku
puzzles in a span of twenty-four hours?” Asuna exclaimed. She
started counting with her fingers. “Let’s see…At a glance, these
look like maximum difficulty, so even an expert would take a good
twenty minutes to solve one. Multiplying that by seven hundred
twenty-eight would be fourteen thousand five hundred sixty
minutes…divided by sixty makes two hundred forty-two hours
and forty minutes…”
I had to admit that the speed of this calculation backed up her
claim to be “pretty good” at math puzzles.
“That’s over ten days!” she exclaimed, her shock turning to
annoyance. “That’s impossible! I’m not going to do them!”
“N-nobody said you had to…At any rate, the sudokers split up
as a group to try to tackle them, and even then, they weren’t fast
enough to beat it by midnight. So on the last day of the beta, they
resorted to forbidden measures.”
“Forbidden…?”
“Since you could log in or out as much as you wanted in the
beta, they would memorize the placement of the hints, then log
out and use an external program to solve the problem…”
“Oh, I see,” Asuna said, smirking.
I concluded the heroes’ tale. “They beat the whole lot just an
hour before the end of the test. Now, do you see how just one tile
out of the eighty-one is a darker color?”
“Hmm, you’re right.”

22|P

“The numbers in those tiles are some kind of key. So at the end
of all that work, the sudokers got seven hundred twenty-eight key
numbers…”
“Uh-huh?”
“And that was it.”
“Huh?”
“Nobody knew what to do with them. They say that for the last
hour until the end of the test, the tragic sudokers were reduced to
running around the square in their underpants, screaming the
numbers and going mad.”
“…”
Asuna’s annoyance turned to pity. She gazed out at the wide
space of flat stone and numbers, lonely in the moonlight. Without
another word on the matter, she closed her eyes for a moment,
then waved her right hand to bring up the menu.
“Oh my, it’s past three. We should go to the inn already. I
assume the DKB and ALS will be sleeping in, too, but I’d still like
to get up and back to business by ten o’clock.”
“Good idea,” I agreed, reminded of my earlier anxiety. But
Asuna’s smile was earnest and innocent.
“Here’s question two, then. What’s your recommended place to
stay in Stachion?”
For about three minutes, we walked east down a road paved with
the same tiles as the square, until I led Asuna to a nondescript,
midsize inn—though, given the way everything in the town was
built out of the same little blocks, it was hard for any of them to
acquire distinguishing features.
I pushed open the wooden door (at least that was different)
and checked in at the counter, reserving two adjacent rooms on
the second floor. The empty hallway up there turned out to be ten
blocks wide, just over six feet, with no place to hide.
I’d kept my hackles up from the moment we’d arrived at this
level of Aincrad till we got to this inn, but no one had been
following or watching us—at least, so I thought. But I couldn’t be
absolutely certain, because now that I suspected the man in the

23|P

black poncho had a Hiding skill at least as good as my Search, I
could no longer trust my eyes and ears.
I walked to the end of the hallway, keenly aware of the stress
of being in potential danger. Asuna was in Room 201 in the
corner, while I was in 202 just before it.
The fencer yawned gracefully in front of her door and glanced
at me. “Um…shall we meet in the restaurant downstairs at
eight…or, no, nine o’clock?”
“That’s fine with me.”
“Then good night, Kirito.”
She waved and grabbed the door handle. But the handle rattled
in place and resisted her pressure.
“Wh…whoops? Is the other one my room…?” she wondered,
shuffling over with sleepy eyes. I grabbed her shoulders.
“Nope, you had the right one.”
“Uh…why isn’t it opening, then?”
Her question was a reasonable one. Inn rooms in Aincrad
didn’t have keys as a general rule; doors automatically unlocked
for the owner (or their registered friends and party members)—a
system choice made for player convenience. And we were in a
party together, so even if she’d gotten my room, the door should
have opened.
I walked over to Asuna, who was half sleepy and half skeptical,
and pointed at the 201 attached to her door. On closer look, the
square plate was split into a four-by-four grid, with the other
squares having fainter numbers of their own and a single blank
space in the bottom right corner.
“Doesn’t this look familiar, too?” I prompted.
Asuna blinked about five times and finally said, “Oh…is this a
fifteen puzzle…?”
“Bingo. Only in this case, the numbers go from zero to
fourteen.”
“……Are you saying that if I don’t solve this puzzle, the door
won’t open?”
“Correct.”
“………”

24|P

Now her expression was 20 percent sleepiness, 20 percent
suspicion, and 60 percent disgust. I hastily added, “B-but don’t
worry. There’s a trick to this…”
I reached up to the plate and started sliding the wooden
numbers around, which were randomly placed aside from the
Room 201 numbers.
“See, it’s easy to get zero through seven in the top two rows,
right? After that, you just line up the eight and twelve in the lower
left, then put the nine and thirteen next to them, and the rest is
natural…”
The moment I slid the fourteen into the right spot, there was
an audible click as the door unlocked. Then I pushed down the
handle, and the door opened inward this time.
“…Thank you,” Asuna said, but her expression did not suggest
gratitude. I’d brought her to this inn for a reason—of all the
puzzle doors in Stachion, the ones here were on the simple side.
But there was something more important to explain to her
now—more important than the facts of this town or this entire
floor. Asuna was quite exhausted, and I was reaching the peak of
my fatigue, too, but the last thing I wanted to do now was put off
this decision until tomorrow, only to regret it.
“Well, good night…” Asuna started to vanish through the
doorway.
I raised my voice just 5 percent higher than normal. “Asuna!”
“What?” she asked, eyes bleary. I felt guilty, but there was no
going back now.
“I…I have something important to tell you. Do you mind if I
come into your room for a bit?”
“Mm…go ahead…”
Her permission came shockingly easy. She tottered through the
doorway. I hurried after her before the door automatically locked
itself.
As the corner room, 201 had large windows on the east and
south sides, but there was no skyline to look at now. The room
was maybe 175 square feet and had standard furniture: a bed that
was spacious enough for one but not two, a sofa set, and a writing

25|P

desk. The floor was dark brown but checkered in that familiar
eight-inch pattern.
Asuna floated weightlessly to the bed and plopped down onto
its soft surface. She waited for me to speak, just barely preventing
herself from flopping over into a sleeping position.
“So what’s this important thing you have to…tell……Important
thing?” she repeated, blinking thrice.
Suddenly, her eyes were wide open. She stared around the
room, then back at me. For some reason, her left hand reached for
a large pillow, and she clutched it in front of her as she
stammered, “Uh…wait…import…I…W-wait, I’m, uh, I’m not, ready
for…”
It wasn’t clear what Asuna was imagining, but fortunately for
me, whatever it was had woken her up a bit. I took a step closer.
“Listen, Asuna.”
“No, wa…w-wait, just wait.”
“No. I can’t wait.”
“What?”

26|P

27|P

She was clutching the pillow so hard it was fit to burst. I took
another step closer.
“Asuna…in the morning, I want you to practice human combat
with me.”
“………Hweh?”
“I know you hate PvP. But we’re coming to the point where
there’s no getting around it. Before we start heading out to tackle
this floor, we should at least spend half a day practicing…”
“Stop.”
Her hand darted out at the speed of lightning, cutting me off.
She took several deep breaths. Eventually, she got to her feet, still
holding the pillow.
“……I knew that I couldn’t keep running away from it. So I
agree with your point about the training. I’m ready for it.”
“Oh…c-cool.”
“But let me just say one thing first.”
The fencer grinned at me kindly, switched the pillow over to
her right hand, then cocked it back.
“That was…extremely misleading!!!!” she screamed, hurling it
at me overhand with a bit of rotation, like a major league pitcher.
The pillow hurtled audibly toward me hard enough to flash up the
purple barrier effect when it landed, no matter how soft it was.
A cold drink of water helped calm Asuna down, after which I
briefly explained what had happened in the castle ruins of
Karluin. While she was furious at necro-poncho—and somewhat
concerned for me as well—she largely accepted the situation
calmly and rationally and agreed to resume dueling practice.
By the end of this, it was already 3:40, so we delayed the next
day’s meeting until nine thirty, and I left Room 201.
Suddenly, the sandman’s bags weighed heavily on my eyelids,
now that I was no longer holding him at bay with sheer
willpower. But there was another job I had to do before I opened
the door to my own room.
Unlike Room 201, the fifteen puzzle to open Room 202 had a
pair of twos, and the highest number was thirteen. While I did
make a few mistakes because of it, I managed to finish the puzzle
28|P

in under thirty seconds. I opened the door into my own room,
removed my gear as I shuffled forward, and plunged into the bed
face-first.
I had time for just a few thoughts in the three seconds before I
fell asleep.
You know, I forgot to actually tell Asuna that the entire theme of
this floor is puzzles.
And what did she mean by “misleading”?

29|P

2
DESPITE THE FACT THAT I FORGOT TO SET A WAKE-UP alarm,
my eyes opened just three minutes before we were scheduled to
meet.
In the real world, I’d never make it in time with that little to
spare, but in here, there was no need to wash your face, brush
your hair, or pick out what to wear. I just rolled out of bed,
equipped the coat over my shirt, and left the room.
The sound of the door opening and slamming was louder than I
expected, and for a moment, I wondered if I was still a bit dazed
with sleep. But no, my fellow guest in the room next door had
emerged at the exact same time.
Asuna and I shared a look for about two seconds. It seemed
like she’d just woken up, too, and her brain wasn’t running at full
capacity yet. In the silence, I heard the number plates of both
doors click and rattle as they shuffled their puzzles.
“Good—” I started to say, but Asuna swept her cape aside and
raced past me toward the stairs.
Why did she run away?!
But the answer occurred to me immediately. She was going to
get to the restaurant a second ahead of me, so she could smugly
accuse me of being the one who slept in.
“N-no fair!” I shouted, starting to run, but I couldn’t catch up to
Asuna at full speed, given her (likely) higher agility stat. Her long
hair shone in the morning sun as it vanished around the end of
the hallway.
I was going to lose the race.
Resigned to bad behavior, I launched myself off the floor and
took one, two, three steps along the nearest wall, dragging the
edges of my soles along the flat stone. This was a non-system skill
I called Wall-Running. Three steps was the best I could do without

30|P

an equipment bonus, but with an Agility dump stat, people like
Argo the Rat could probably go much longer.
Still, it was enough to get me to the corner of the hallway, so on
my third step, I pushed hard and leaped to the far wall around the
corner, then jumped off that to the handrail on the stairs. I landed
right behind Asuna, who’d slowed down at the hallway turn that
sat at the stairs’ landing. With one more huge jump, I slipped past
her and rushed into the first-floor lobby.
“Hey, no fair!” she shouted behind me, but athletic competition
was inherently unfair. The entrance to the restaurant was past the
reception desk. I lowered my center of gravity in preparation for
the last fifty feet of the race—
“Hi-yah!” went an unsettling cry over my shoulder, and I felt
myself being pulled backward. My soles lost their grip and slid
along the polished floor. Asuna had grabbed the hem of my coat.
“Hey…foul! Foul!” I wailed as I fell onto my butt, but there was
no referee’s whistle.
Right beside my face, I heard her say “Later!” as white leather
boots raced past me.
Yes—there were no rules or referees in this battle. Only our
good consciences limited what we would do. And I was the kind of
person who was furthest from the concept of a good conscience: I
was a teenage boy and a former beta tester.
I reached out without a word and grabbed Asuna’s left ankle.
“Heywha?!” the fencer exclaimed, a strange abbreviation of
Hey, what are you doing? and she lost her balance. A second after
we both rolled over onto the floor, the NPC lady behind the
counter called out, “Please, no disruptions inside the building.” If
it wasn’t my imagination, her voice seemed colder than usual.
We sat at the farthest table in the back of the restaurant and
ordered the breakfast platters and coffee.
Asuna sighed. “Haaah…The last thing I need in the morning is
to get all tired out…”
“W-well, you were the one who started running first.”
“I was just picking up my pace, that’s all.”

31|P

I knew she was lying, but the food arrived before I could call
her out on it. The breakfast platter varied depending on the town
and establishment; this one had two buttered rolls, green salad,
cheese, ham, and eggs, which was a fairly orthodox combination.
Asuna neatly sliced the square of cheese into two triangles and
noted, “You don’t have to solve a puzzle to get your food.”
“Oh, would you prefer it that way? For lunch, I know a place
that sells a meal served in a puzzle box…”
“No, thank you,” she said, picking up the hard cheese with her
fingers and taking a nibble. We ate in silence after that, and it
wasn’t until the both of us were half-done with our plates that
Asuna spoke again.
“…So why are there so many puzzles all over Stachion?”
“Oh. It’s because the theme of this floor is puzzles,” I said,
finally revealing the detail I’d forgotten to tell her last night. The
fencer blinked in surprise.
“You mean…it’s not just the main town, but it’s the entire floor
that’s like this?”
“Yep. Most of the dungeons are full of puzzles and tricks. It was
a floor that really divided the player base during the beta, I can
tell you that.”
“Uh…huh…”
There was something odd in Asuna’s look, but with my low
Communication skill, I couldn’t make out what it was.
“…What does that expression mean?” I asked her, sticking ham
inside of the slit in my mini-loaf of hard bread. Asuna shrugged.
“Well, it’s not that I hate puzzles themselves…I like the sudoku
number games from the square—and jigsaw puzzles and
disentanglement puzzles and the like. But…when I think about the
fifth-floor boss, I get worried…”
“Oh. Good point…”
At last, I understood why she looked upset. The floor boss we’d
just defeated yesterday—Fuscus the Vacant Colossus—started off
like your archetypal RPG golem monster but turned out to be
horribly different—a creature fused with the very chamber itself.
It then deployed a number of complex gimmicks and tricks that
were a huge headache for the raid party.
32|P

“So does that mean if the floor’s theme is puzzles that the boss
is the same way?” Asuna asked.
“Kind of,” I admitted. “The boss in the beta was kind of like a
Rubik’s Cube with arms and legs. The row you attacked would
rotate, and once you got all the sides aligned, its armor would
break off. But because everyone just went ham on it, the colors
would get more and more out of alignment…”
“…”
Asuna sighed deeply, her fork paused in midair with a
cucumber-like vegetable on it. “That’s exactly the kind of thing
that Lind from the DKB and Kibaou from the ALS are going to
argue over—who gets to call the shots in battle. Maybe it’s better
that we tackle this boss with the same group as the last one?”
It was bold, but I had to shake the idea off. “No, no way. We had
no other choice in the matter to prevent the ALS from rushing
ahead…but the entire point of boss fights is to use a full raid party
and go in at maximum strength. And you never know if it might’ve
been changed since the beta.”
“Probably to make it more annoying, if anything.”
This time I had to agree. I didn’t want to imagine a setup more
annoying than the Rubik’s Cube, but if any pattern had held true
so far, it was that nothing had been made easier since the beta.
On top of that, I had another problem to deal with regarding
the boss battle beyond just the potential puzzle tricks.
Asuna sensed something in my expression. She chewed on a
slice of cucumber and waved her fork like a little flag. “Speaking of
which…what are you going to do with that thing you’re holding?”
“Dunno,” I said. She made a face that said she figured that was
the answer.
The “thing” I was holding was the Flag of Valor, an ultrarare
item that the fifth-floor boss dropped—otherwise known as the
guild flag.
If you registered the flag under your guild name and stood it
upright on the floor, any guild member within a radius of fifty feet
would enjoy four different kinds of status buffing. The reason
Kibaou’s ALS had attempted to sneak into a fight against the boss

33|P

first was because they were afraid the DKB would get the guild
flag and the incredible bonus it conferred.
But the impromptu raid party that Asuna and I had scraped
together beat the fifth-floor boss first, and the flag in question
came into my possession. Lind probably didn’t know about the
very existence of the flag yet, so I was going to set up a meeting
with the chief DKB members later that day to explain everything.
Understanding the man’s pride, there was no telling how he
would react.
When Kibaou barged into the boss chamber right after we
defeated Fuscus, I gave him the conditions that would need to be
fulfilled before I handed over the guild flag.
One: I would hold on to the flag until another one of them
showed up, at which point I’d give it up so that the ALS and DKB
would each have one.
Or two: If the ALS and DKB merged, I would give them the flag
immediately.
Either one of these would be satisfactory to me, but I knew that
neither was a realistic outcome. It was such a game-changing item
that players called it “broken,” so there wouldn’t be multiple
copies of that kind of thing dropping left and right—in the beta,
only the one on the fifth floor ever showed up. And the DKB and
ALS, who held opposing ideologies, merging into one? Even more
unlikely.
“…If we give the flag to either guild, it’ll destroy the balance
we’ve got now. It’ll permanently destroy any chance at peace
between the two sides, and in the worst-case scenario, it could
wipe out half the power of the frontier-advancing group,” I
mumbled, staring at the parsley-like green left on my plate. I
sensed Asuna nodding along. Then I plucked up the leafy thing
and twirled it in my fingers. “But it’s also so powerful that letting
it rot away in my inventory would be a waste…At the present
moment, we have hardly any means of adding combat buffs, and
this will provide four different kinds, just from sticking a flag into
the ground…”
“What specific buffs, exactly?”

34|P

“Increased attack power, increased defensive power,
shortened cooldowns, and increased resistance to all debuffs.”
“Wow…”
Her voice was hushed with awe. Asuna was still new to the
general concepts of RPGs, but even she could recognize what
tremendous benefits this combination of effects represented.
“Of course, in sheer numerical terms, the individual values are
pretty small, but it can also affect any number of players—and for
an unlimited amount of time…And the craziest part of all is that
the guild flag itself is categorized as a polearm weapon with a
number of possible upgrade attempts…”
“Oh…h-how many?”
“Ten.”
Again, an incredulous look crossed Asuna’s face. “And…I’m
guessing…that’s not to increase its power as a weapon, but…”
“It should also affect the buffing percentages. I’m almost afraid
to imagine what it would be like if you successfully upgraded it all
ten times.”
“Hrmmm,” the fencer grunted uncharacteristically. She pointed
her fork and knife at me. “Then what about this idea?”
“What’s that?”
“Why don’t you start a new guild, register the flag, and absorb
both the DKB and ALS?”
A sound that if transcribed would be spelled something like
blrmpph shot from my mouth. Thankfully, I avoided spraying halfchewed parsley mist into Asuna’s face, but something seemed
very buggy in the game’s taste emulator—my mouth felt weirdly
textured. I took a swig of coffee to reset, inhaled and exhaled
several times, then expressed myself more rationally this time.
“Absolutely not. Zero percent chance. Zero-point-zero-zerozero-zero!”
“……”
The look on her face said What are you, a child? She took a
delicate sip of her coffee. “It was only a suggestion. I know it’s not
to your liking, and I have no desire at all to be the subleader of
any guild. The most practical version of the idea would be to ask
Agil…but even that seems unlikely to work…”
35|P

She lapsed into silence, thinking hard. I considered asking if
she would actually agree to be my vice-captain in a hypothetical
guild, but I wasn’t sure it was a good idea to bring up. I decided to
keep it locked away in my mental inventory for now.
“…Well, Agil’s already leading a guild of his own…but if we had
him expand the Bro Squad into a larger organization, I feel like
he’d force them all to use two-handed weapons…”
“Ah-ha-ha-ha, no way.” Asuna laughed, only to suddenly stop.
She must’ve imagined herself as a member of the Bro Squad,
wielding a huge war hammer. She shook her head. “A-anyway, we
ought to think of a way to effectively use that guild flag. Let’s hope
that Lind has some constructive ideas in mind…”
“Yeah, no kidding…”
At that, the clock hit ten. Our meeting with the DKB was at
twelve thirty and would be held somewhere in Stachion. So
factoring in travel time, that left us with about two hours to kill. I
tossed the last scrap of bread into my mouth, mumbled a thanks
for the meal, and gave my partner a suggestion.
“Um, to round out the morning, why don’t we go all over
Stachion, accept all the quests we can, and clear out one or two of
the easy ones? Or we can practice dueling, like we talked about
yesterday. Which do you prefer?”
“Hmm,” Asuna murmured, but her answer came very quickly.
“Practice. I don’t want to put it off and then regret it later.”
“Oh…c-cool,” I said, taken aback by her choice. “In that case,
let’s find somewhere we can be alone. If people overhear or spy
on our practice, it’ll only have the opposite effect.”
“Sounds good…but do you have a place in mind?”
“I might.” I grinned, leaping to my feet.
Unlike last night, the teleport square was bustling with players.
More than a few had parchment and quill in hand, staring at the
numbered tiles. It wasn’t yet clear if these were going to be the
new generation of sudokers, but I wished them a silent good luck
and hopped through the glowing blue gate at the center of the
square.

36|P

Our destination was Zumfut, the main town of the third floor.
But the town itself was not what I wanted. I led us right past the
three giant baobab trees out into the map and off the trail. Once I
was certain there were no players following us, I took us at a
sprint southwest, into the deep forest.
Monsters targeted us now and then, but at this point, Asuna
and I were strong enough that an ambush of small treants or giant
spiders in the Forest of Wavering Mists needed no more than two
sword skills to clean up. We ignored them and continued running,
leaving them all in the dust.
Eventually, a valley came into view, the mist trailing through it
in ropes even thicker than usual. I left my map open and
continued running right through the valley for another minute.
Suddenly, the mist vanished like it had never been there, and
tall black banners appeared before my eyes. They featured a
scimitar and a horn, and beyond them was a hollow in the valley,
inside of which were nearly twenty dark purple tents of various
sizes. But this was no ordinary village—it was the campground of
the dark elf warriors, a place that only players aligned with the
dark elf faction of the multi-floor “Elf War” campaign quest could
visit. On top of that, it was an instanced map generated for each
separate party, meaning the game system itself prevented any
other player from even seeing it, much less getting inside.
Asuna bowed to the expressionless guards as she passed them,
then murmured to me, “It’s been over ten days since we were last
here. It’s nice to be back…but why now? Are you saying there’s
nowhere private we could find in Stachion or Karluin?”
“There are…but there was one other thing I wanted to clean
up.”
“What’s that…? Isn’t the next destination for the ‘Elf War’ quest
on the sixth floor?”
I nodded. The general story of the campaign, which had started
on this floor, was that the dark elves and forest elves were
fighting for six secret keys that opened the gate to a place called
the Sanctuary that existed somewhere in Aincrad. But behind this
conflict lurked the Fallen Elves, who were secretly after the keys
as well.
37|P

We’d gained the Jade Key on the third floor, the Lapis Key on
the fourth, and the Amber Key on the fifth. The elite dark elf
knight Kizmel used a spirit tree, a special means of travel just for
the elves, to transport the keys to a fortress in the northwest
region of the sixth floor, where they were stored now. Once we
reached that fort, the sixth-floor portion of the campaign would
launch—but I had stuff to take care of before we did that.
“This errand has nothing to do with any quests. I just wanna
power this guy up,” I said, reaching behind me to brush the hilt of
my sword. Asuna murmured in understanding.
In the center of the long hollow in the valley was the massive
dining tent, in front of which was a tiny commerce area. Along the
path was an item shop, a tailor, a leatherworker, and a blacksmith.
It looked the same as it did the last time we visited, except that
the normally passive and brusque elves actually called out to us
this time, greeting us and asking how we were. I was so taken
aback by this that all I could do was nod back, but Asuna flashed
them a smile and said, “Good day!”
I guessed that some kind of affinity value with the dark elves
was rising as we proceeded further in the campaign quest, and
that it meant our fame and wanted value among the forest elves
was rising along with it. We hadn’t interacted with them on the
fifth floor, so I just had to pray that the pattern would hold for the
sixth as well.
I stopped us at the fourth shop in the row. Out in front was a
stern-looking man wearing a heavy apron and long gloves, his
hair tied in a ponytail, beating a piece of red-hot metal on top of
an anvil with rhythmic strikes. After the change in the other elves,
I assumed he would be more friendly as well, so I waited for a
pause in the work before calling out, “H…hiya!”
The man glared at us, snorted, then went back to work.
“…Well, he hasn’t changed a bit,” whispered Asuna, holding
back her giggles, but I wouldn’t be broken yet.
I took the entire sheath off my back and said, “Um, I’d like to
strengthen this sword.”

38|P

He snorted again. The only indication this wasn’t a refusal of
my request was that a special NPC blacksmith window had
appeared before me.
I swear, I’m gonna get this guy to like me someday, I thought as I
entered my work request into the window.
My Anneal Blade +8 had been my trusty sidekick since shortly
after the start of this game of death, but it broke in half in the fight
against the forest elf commander during the battle at Yofel Castle
on the fourth floor. Now I was using the Sword of Eventide, a onehanded longsword that had been a reward for winning that fight.
On top of its excellent base stats, it had a magic effect that added
+7 agility. With it equipped, my ability to Wall-Run stretched from
three steps at best all the way to nearly ten.
However, powerful weapons were also difficult to upgrade as a
general rule. So I’d been using it without attempting to increase
its power all through the fifth floor. Now that we were going to
tackle the sixth, I wanted to at least get it up to +3. And as far as I
knew, the best NPC blacksmith I could call upon was this fellow.
With skill like his, a little unfriendliness wasn’t going to be a
problem…I hoped.
I set the materials that matched my weapon type on the menu
screen and paused to think when I reached the additive materials
section.
The weapon-upgrading system in SAO allowed you to choose
between five different parameters: Sharpness, Heaviness,
Quickness, Accuracy, and Durability. Sharpness (or Toughness for
blunt weapons) simply increased its damage, and Heaviness
increased the chances of breaking an opponent’s weapon or
armor. Quickness improved the speed of regular attacks and
sword skills, while Accuracy improved the critical rate, and
Durability increased the weapon’s own ability to withstand
damage. Any of them would be an improvement, but the smart
move was to choose values that matched your combat style. I
often chose Sharpness and Durability for my upgrades, because
they didn’t interface with system assistance the way the others
did.

39|P

I decided I would go for Sharpness twice and Durability once,
so I selected the maximum number of additional materials that
corresponded to Sharpness, then hit the OK button. When dealing
with a player blacksmith, you had to manually choose the needed
materials and extras from your own inventory, but with an NPC, it
was all automatic. A little bag filled with the materials appeared
over the window. I held it out with one hand and grasped my
sword with the other, then I asked the blacksmith to go ahead.
But the elf ignored the bag of materials in my hand and took
just the sword. He pulled it from the sheath and let the blade
catch the morning sunlight. A little furrow appeared between his
brows.
“…Is this the work of a Lyusulan master?” he asked abruptly. At
first, I panicked, wondering if this was the start of some in-game
event, but I had to be honest at this point. The kingdom of Lyusula
was the dark elf nation that existed on the land before Aincrad
was created, and they still called themselves the people of
Lyusula.
“Y-yes…I received it from the master of Yofel Castle on the
fourth floor.”
“Ahh, a piece from Leyshren’s family, then.”
I leaned over to Asuna, feeling like I’d probably heard that
name before, and whispered, “Uh…who was that again?”
“Come on, pay attention and remember things. That was the
name of Viscount Yofilis.”
“Oh, right,” I said, but then I frowned, uncertain. The
blacksmith had just referred to that dark elf noble by his first
name in a rather casual manner, but I couldn’t tell if that was a
notable thing or if it was simply the customary way of their
culture.
He didn’t seem to pay any attention to our whispers, though.
He continued examining the beautiful sword. “You ordered an
improvement to Sharpness, correct?”
“Yes, to start with.”
“Don’t bother.”
“……Huh?”

40|P

Now I was truly stunned. I could feel my eyes and mouth
bulging wide. Old Man Romolo, the shipwright who built our
gondola on the fourth floor, had been somewhat of a crank by NPC
standards, but even he didn’t outright refuse a request for his
services. Yet the elf blacksmith was going to turn down the order
that I’d entered through the system menu itself. He’d never
uttered a word of complaint when I had him augment the
Sharpness of the Anneal Blade…
“Um…wh-why not?” I asked.
The blacksmith snorted with obvious annoyance, but at least
this time he did explain himself. “This sword is already sharp
enough. Sharpening it further will not improve it.”
“I…see…”
I guessed that meant that compared to the Anneal Blade, giving
it +1 Sharpness would only provide a small extra boost of attack
power.
It was true that weapon upgrading ought to be appropriate for
the type of weapon. Boosting the Quickness of a massive twohanded war hammer once or twice would barely register any
change in speed—and increasing the Heaviness of a quick rapier
or dagger would only wipe out its special nature without
improving its ability to destroy other weapons and armor.
But I’d never considered that there might be individual
tendencies among different weapons in the same one-handed
sword category when it came to upgrading. Taken aback, I asked
him, “Then what kind of improvement would you recommend?”
“Choose whichever quality you like, aside from Sharpness…is
what I might ordinarily say, but if Leyshren owed you enough to
give you this, I suppose you deserve keener advice,” he said icily.
The blacksmith gazed closely at the Sword of Eventide again.
“Accuracy would be good for this sword.”
“Awww…” I blurted out like a petulant child.
Upgrading Accuracy increased a weapon’s critical rate: This
much was undeniable fact. The problem was that the debate
about just what a critical hit was in SAO hadn’t been settled yet.

41|P

Many monsters had defined weak points, which, if hit cleanly,
suffered huge damage. Nearly all players understood this to be a
critical hit.
But aside from that, when hitting non-weak spots, there was a
very rare chance that the striking effect would be just a bit
flashier than usual—and deliver just a bit more damage. It was
easier to do this with sword skills than normal attacks, but it was
also not the same thing as the “power boost” technique you could
take advantage of by throwing your arms and legs further into the
movements the system helped you make automatically during a
sword skill. This was something where the exact same sword skill
in the exact same spot on the enemy might or might not cause the
effect—it was completely up to chance.
If you listened to the critical hit fundamentalists who’d been
studying crits since the beta (we called them critters), hitting an
enemy’s weak point was a skill, and major damage scored through
player skill was not a critical. They were searching for that
random extra damage roll, the true critical hit from RPGs of
yore—the thing that couldn’t be affected by clever technique.
Beyond this point was a bottomless swamp of data, idealism,
and cultish fanaticism from which escape was nearly impossible.
The critters would tell you that a true critical was determined by
how truly serious the NerveGear detected the player was; that it
was easier to score the more wood your weapon contained; that
the fewer HP you had left, the higher the rate; that a full moon
increased your chances; and on and on…There wasn’t enough
time or life to rigorously test any or all of these theories.
And in all honesty, I had no desire to get anywhere near that
swamp, but the problem was that I knew there were true criticals
that were different from weak-point criticals. The pleasure of
seeing the 20-percent exaggerated effect and major damage was
addicting once you got used to it. I wasn’t a critter by a long shot,
but on the other hand, I’d been keeping my modification slot open
for the five days since I reached 150 proficiency in one-handed
swords because I couldn’t choose whether I wanted Shortened
Skill Delay or Critical Rate Increase, which I had to assume
affected the chances of a true crit.
42|P

You’d think that if it was this tempting, I should just go for the
critical rate boost, but the problem was that upgrading weapon
Accuracy affected only weak-point criticals, not true criticals.
When a weapon’s Accuracy had been boosted, the system
automatically adjusted to improve your aim when trying to hit a
monster’s weak spot. Some players, like Asuna, could master this
system and use it like second nature. But I didn’t hang with any
kind of system assistance that took control away from me. During
the beta test, I tried out an Anneal Blade with Accuracy increased
to +8, and the sensation of the sword curving straight for the
monster’s weak spot made me feel like I was wielding a living
weapon with a mind of its own.
So…how was I supposed to explain to the dark elf this very
particular quirk of mine, based on preference rather than rational
gain? If I insisted on Sharpness, that might solve the matter, but it
seemed like there was a 1—no, a 10-percent chance that this
particular NPC would say “Then I won’t do it.” Instead, I just
glanced back and forth between the sword and his face.
Finally, Asuna broke the stalemate with a perfect, simple
solution.
“Why isn’t Sharpness the best choice?” she asked.
The blacksmith nodded. “Of all of Lyusula’s great blades, this
one is especially sharp—and thus fragile. To preserve and protect
the blade, it is best to dispatch the enemy with as few strikes as
possible. That means Accuracy would be best, followed by
Durability.”
“Ah, I see…So the Accuracy is to make fighting more efficient,”
Asuna said, echoing my own reaction.
The sword’s Durability wasn’t bad at all according to its specs,
but ever since I’d started using it, I noticed that it seemed to
deplete on the quick side in battle. The Sword of Eventide was
better at slicing away at uncovered or undefended spots than at
smashing through layers of armor, presumably. If one focused on
hitting weak points from the very start, then the effect of the
system assistance kicking in might not be that disorienting, after
all.

43|P

It hadn’t eliminated all of my misgivings, but if this was a
sword forged by a dark elf, it was probably best to accept a dark
elf blacksmith’s advice about it. “Okay…I understand. Then let’s
upgrade its Accuracy, please,” I said.
“Very well,” the blacksmith replied, and the window popped up
once more. I reset the items and values, hit the OK button again,
and grabbed the bag of materials that appeared.
The blacksmith took the items and tossed them into the
furnace that seemed to be made of wood. The materials melted
instantly, and the orange flames began to glow blue. He stuck the
Sword of Eventide in, and it promptly took on a blue glow of its
own.
Then he transferred the sword to the anvil—I couldn’t tell why
he chose the specific timing of it—and began to smack it with his
hammer. With just ten strikes, quick enough that I didn’t have
time to get nervous, the sword promptly flashed brighter.
“It is done,” he said, thrusting the sword toward me.
“Um,” I said without taking it, “I’d like another round of
Accuracy, actually, followed by Durability.”
Even maximizing the amount of materials you could put into the
process, upgrading couldn’t get higher than a 95-percent chance
of success, but the blacksmith easily cranked out three perfect
attempts. It was my nature to want to keep the streak going, but
that was sadly the end of my stock of mats. I still had three moomoo planks (the cow-branded metal pieces) that could boost your
chances to maximum in one go, but I was saving them for when it
was really necessary.
Instead, Asuna decided to get up to +7 on her Chivalric
Rapier—the scary part was that she still had eight attempts left—
and then we thanked the blacksmith, who gave us a disinterested
snort and returned to his business. I was curious about why he
called Viscount Yofilis by the name Leyshren, but we didn’t have
time, so that would have to wait for another day.
We also stopped at the leatherworker and the seamstress for
some upgrades to our armor—both of these were women and at
least five times friendlier than the smith. When this was done,
44|P

Asuna and I moved to the outdoor training grounds at the
western end of the encampment. It was now 10:40, so even
accounting for travel, we had a full hour to practice.
There was no way I could teach her every little trick and lesson
I’d picked up over my time with the game, and that was likely to
backfire with Asuna anyway. Teaching her more about the
essentials, about the mind-set that one needed, was far more
likely to help her make use of her own creativity and proactive
capabilities.
The problem was that giving a lecture on mental outlook was
much harder than talking about technique. And it was all the
more difficult when the teacher was just a dumb kid like me with
no experience teaching.
I came to a stop at the entrance to the empty training grounds,
glanced at Asuna, who was standing at a thirty-degree angle from
me, and came up completely short on how to start even the first
sentence. All I could think about was the way Asuna had said I
don’t want to do this when we tried practicing dueling on the
fourth floor.
“Soooo……ummmm……”
I hemmed and hawed, trying to find an entry point to the topic.
Suddenly, Asuna giggled and said, “Listen, Kirito.”
“Y…yes?”
“I went into the bath with Argo when we were in the town of
Shiyaya on the fifth floor.”
“Y…yes?”
It sounded familiar to me, I just couldn’t wrap my head around
why she was bringing it up now. I looked at her suspiciously. “Rright, I seem to recall that. You and Argo were having a little girlon-girl chat in the…”
“We were doing no such thing!” she said, pouting briefly. Then
she grinned. “No, Argo and I had a duel there.”
“……Wha—? In the…bath?”
“In the bath.”
“……With…no gear?”
“With swimsui…Wait, that’s not the point!”

45|P

She jabbed me in the gut with her first two fingers pressed
together. Belatedly, I recalled that we weren’t in a town safe
zone—but to my relief, she didn’t do anything worse than that.
“…But when I say duel, all we did was smack each other with
the bundles of fragrant herbs they put in the bathtub. Argo asked
me…if I was afraid of dueling.”
“…A-and what did you say…?”
“I was honest. I told her I was scared, but thinking on it, Argo
uses all of her points for agility, so she’s got even less HP than me.
Yet, in the duel, she fought hard with just a bundle of plants and
didn’t seem nervous at all. She heads into the latest dungeon
without an ounce of hesitation…So in return, I asked her, ‘Aren’t
you afraid?’”
“……A-a-and she said…?”
“‘’Fraid I can’t tell ya that for free,’” Asuna said, a remarkable
imitation of Argo the Rat’s speaking style, and headed for the
other end of the grounds.
I called out after her. “Um, c-could you explain what that story
is supposed to mean?”
The fencer turned back, her long hair swishing, and gave me a
devilish grin. “What do you suppose it means?”
How the hell should I know?! I shouted inwardly. Chances were,
Asuna was trying to say that she was all right now. So I just had to
teach her as much as I could in the short time we had. Once she
got over her fear of fighting another human player, there was
nothing left to hold back Asuna’s potential and the sharp point of
her +7 Chivalric Rapier.
I glanced up at the forest surrounding the camp and whispered
a warning to the man in the black poncho and his friends,
wherever in Aincrad they were now.
“Next time I’m gonna get you.”
“Huh? Did you say something?” Asuna shouted.
“Nothing!” I shouted back, hurrying over the short grass
toward my partner.

WHEN WE RETURNED TO STACHION, THE TELEPORT square
was jammed with players. The majority looked like tourists from
the first floor, but there were also a surprising number of
“catchers-up” loaded with fairly decent gear.
This second group had gotten off to a start a month or two
later than the present-day advancement group and weren’t a high
enough level to hang in the frontier zones, but shopping in town
was perfectly safe. And since it was RPG custom that the further a
town was in the game, the better its equipment, every new
destination was a chance to buy into a better round of gear—if
you could afford it.
In that sense, Kibaou’s Aincrad Liberation Squad and their
stated aims of sharing money, items, and information as widely as
possible weren’t wrong. If the frontline groups used their
earnings to help outfit the people catching up, they’d be able to
gain XP more safely—and reach the frontier much quicker.
But the actual method of distribution was rather tricky. It
wasn’t as if the advancement group was drowning in money, so
you’d only want to distribute money to those players who were
truly serious about reaching the front line. But in order to identify
them from the rest, you’d need to do some time-consuming
background checks and skill tests. Even the large ALS didn’t have
the man power to bother with something that involved, and if
they did, acting like heavy-handed police or military might only
inspire mistrust instead.
When I beat everyone to the punch by defeating the fifth-floor
boss and looting the guild flag first, Kibaou quietly thanked me.
He must’ve understood that we were forced to do this to prevent
the coalition of frontline groups from fracturing. He might have a
foul mouth, but he wasn’t a bad person. It was why he was so

47|P

dedicated to the noble cause of redistributing resources to give
everyone a fair shot.
On the other hand, Lind of the Dragon Knights Brigade was the
polar opposite—a man who proposed concentrating resources
instead. He wanted to create a band of heroes who would
accumulate all the money and gear and experience, shining bright
at the forefront of the game. The idea was that this would inspire
the lower players to work even harder in the hopes of joining his
team—a choice of ideals that seemed at odds with reality.
But one thing was certain: If the unique guild flag item was
going to work better in either the ALS or DKB, it would clearly be
the latter. And Asuna and I needed to explain the flag’s crazy
effects to Lind’s guild, as well as the requirements for us to
actually give it up.
“…Just five more minutes now…Have they settled on a place?”
Asuna asked after she emerged from the teleporter. I checked my
instant messages.
“It says we’re meeting at an inn called the Pegasus Hoof. It’s
that one over there,” I said, using my memory from the beta to
point at a white building on the north side of the square. It was
much bigger than the Fifteen Numbers, where we were staying.
Stachion was arranged like a gentle series of steps, with the
northern side being higher and the southern sinking lower. I used
the word steps rather than hill because the ground was made up
of those eight-inch cube tiles, so there was no natural slope to be
found. It wasn’t as simple as just uniform steps lined up across the
entire town, but if you traveled north and south enough, you
would undoubtedly find yourself going up and down stairs.
As we walked toward the inn, Asuna looked up at the north
side and asked, “So…who lives in the biggest building up at the
north end?”
“That’s the lord’s mansion. He’s, uh, a guy named Cylon, with a
beard. He gives you a bunch of quests, so we’ll be there a few
times. It gets real tiring climbing all those stairs, though…There’s
just something mentally draining about stairs, as opposed to an
ordinary hill.”

48|P

Asuna didn’t comment on any of that. She frowned and
murmured, “Cylon…Where have I heard that name before…?”
“Wasn’t that the bad guy from The Lord of the Rings?”
“That was Sauron, dummy…Well, whatever. How many
minutes to go?”
“Um…one minute, twenty-two seconds.”
“They’re going to be so conceited if we’re late. Let’s run!”
The fencer tore off down the tiles for our destination, and I had
to rush to keep up. We passed through the large door of the
Pegasus Hoof at seven seconds before twelve thirty, but the bluehaired man seated on the sofa in the lobby promptly and loudly
said, “You’re late. It’s common practice to arrive for any meeting
five minutes before the agreed-upon time.”
If we were going to get sniped at one way or the other, I
wished we’d come five minutes late. Instead, I had no choice but
to wave at Lind, leader of the Dragon Knights Brigade guild, and
his officers Shivata and Hafner. “Yo. You guys eat already?”
As young as they might have looked, they were at least in their
late teens, so as a middle schooler, I ought to have asked, “Did you
gentlemen already enjoy your lunchtime?” But this was Aincrad,
the land of outlaws. On top of that, people seemed to think I was
two, three, maybe even four or five years older than I really was,
so the only thing all that extra verbiage would do was clog up my
online connection with voice data.
Lind didn’t seem bothered by my attitude. It was more the
content of the message he took offense to, a furrow running
through his brow.
“We have been waiting here for fifteen minutes already. Where
would we find that kind of time?”
It seemed to me like that was plenty of time, but I decided to
keep it friendly and suggested, “Then why don’t we talk over a
meal? You’re just going to head right back out for more
adventuring in the afternoon, aren’t you?”
This was a profound bit of strategizing by my standards,
hoping that Lind’s attitude might soften over some good food, but
the blue-haired guild master shook his head. “No, I don’t want any

49|P

chance that we’ll be overheard…We’re going to talk in a room that
my guild has reserved for the purpose.”
“…Got it,” I said after a pause. If Lind was renting the room, no
one else might be able to unlock the door, but it would still open
from the inside, and we were within the town, so they couldn’t do
anything to hold us there by force. I didn’t think the leader of a
powerful guild would stoop to such a thing, but the guild flag had
all the magical allure of the One Ring, so I had to be careful.
Lind rose from his seat and took Shivata and Hafner—whom I
secretly nicknamed the track athlete and soccer player,
respectively—toward a staircase at the back of the lobby. If
anything, Lind seemed like a member of the calligraphy club,
although that might’ve just been because the back of his ponytail
looked like the tip of a brush to me.
As I followed the trio, I couldn’t keep my mind from wandering
over some truly pointless subjects. Maybe, if I really need to write
something on parchment, and I have ink but no quill pen, I could dip
that tail into the ink and…
They led us to the Pegasus Hoof’s third-floor suite. It seemed
like a sure sign that they were a big, wealthy guild…except one
thing stuck out to me.
“Hey, guys, did you go into this room ahead of time?” I asked,
right before we reached the door.
Lind turned around and answered peevishly, “No, we just
rented the room at the desk.”
“I see…so you haven’t tried this puzzle yet.” I pointed at a very
complicated, messy metal object placed in an alcove next to the
door.
“What’s that?” Hafner wondered, raising a thick eyebrow. But
Asuna seemed to have recognized what the object was.
“Where did the DKB stay last night?” she asked them.
“Well, we were having fun as a group at the year-end
party…and we ended up passing out at the room in Karluin where
we were celebrating. We didn’t come up to the sixth floor until
this morning.”
“I see.”

50|P

Asuna shot me a glance. Apparently, explaining the situation
was my job, so I cleared my throat.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve noticed that this town—in fact, this
entire floor—is covered in puzzles…and so are the inns. Pretty
much every inn requires you to solve some kind of puzzle before
you can open your room door. The type varies depending on the
establishment, and the Pegasus Hoof specializes in cast metal
puzzles…which are like big, heavy disentanglement puzzles. The
cheapest rooms are fairly simple horseshoe puzzles, but the more
expensive the inn, the trickier they get…”
“…………”
The track, soccer, and calligraphy club members stared at the
metal object in the wall niche. After they traded a series of looks
that suggested No, you go first, Shivata gave up and reached for it.
The puzzle was three tightly interlocked U-shaped parts with
little protrusions like deer antlers on them. Two of the parts were
chained to the wall, and the third had the door key stuck to it. It
would not come loose unless it slid off at just the right position
and angle. It must’ve taken quite a lot of precision and data to recreate such a complex puzzle with 3-D models.
Shivata rattled the puzzle for about thirty seconds before he
threw up his hands and backed away. Hafner didn’t even last for
twenty. Lind was third, positively glowing with an aura that said
For the glory of the guild!
Observing from a distance of six feet, Asuna whispered to me,
“I guess the name Pegasus Hoof was a hint as to these horseshoe
puzzles.”
“The fifteen puzzles at our inn were a lot better, huh?”
“Once you figure out the trick, maybe…”
Lind’s valiant attempt at the puzzle continued while we
chatted, but he, too, came to a stop after about a minute of trying.
“…It is not coming off. Something must be stuck.”
“Now, now, Lin, it wouldn’t be a true puzzle if there’s no
solution.”
“Then you do it, Haf.”
“Listen, I’m not good at these things…”

51|P

A part of me wanted to keep observing this very rare glimpse
at the DKB members acting casually, but the conversation we
were supposed to have would be tricky enough as it was, so this
was my cue to step in and help.
“Pardon me,” I said, barging in with a little hand chop and
taking the tangled metal puzzle. It was four months ago that I’d
been tackling this town’s puzzles in the beta, but the muscle
memory for these cast-metal puzzles was still there…I hoped.
At the time, if you fell asleep in an inn bed, the NerveGear
automatically logged you out of the dive, so that when you woke
up, you were in your real-world room again. The sleep log-out
was a popular trick among beta testers because it allowed you to
avoid the usual intoxication of emerging from a full dive, but I
didn’t get to try it more than a few times before the test was over.
In the meantime, I kept my hands moving, slowly getting past
one protrusion after another, until the part with the key on it
came loose.
“Here.” I handed it over to Lind, who looked conflicted about
this development. He stuck it into the lock and turned it left. The
lock clicked heavily.
“So…what do I do with this n—” he started to ask, but the key
rose out of his hand on its own and floated back into the wall
niche. It tangled itself back up with the two chained pieces until
the puzzle was back to its original position.
“……The heck was that?” asked Shivata.
“It’s kind of like magic, kind of like a curse. The lord here will
explain it to you,” I told him, clapping Lind on the shoulder.
“C’mon, let’s get this conversation going. I’m sure you’re busy,
too.”
The Pegasus Hoof suite was, indeed, quite deluxe—in addition to
a large living room, it had two separate bedrooms, a small kitchen,
and a bathroom. Asuna’s fixation kicked in briefly as she glanced
toward the bathroom door, but given that she had just bathed at
the dark elf camp, her bath meter was stable for the moment, and
she passed by it without further inspection.

52|P

“…Why did you rent such an expensive spot?” I wondered,
gazing out the large window at the town of Stachion below.
It wasn’t Lind, but it was Hafner who said, “It’s an issue of
security. If someone just happens to wait outside the door with
the Eavesdropping skill, it’s more likely that we’ll be out of their
effective range if the room is extra-large, right?”
“Ah, I see…”
That at least confirmed for me how serious a matter the DKB
considered this talk to be. There was a sofa set in the middle of
the living area, but Shivata and Hafner decided to move it to the
window on the south side out of an abundance of caution, getting
it as far from the door as possible. I was going to suggest that they
should just post guards outside the door, but then I realized
they’d naturally have other members hiding out in the lobby
below already.
The furniture set featured a sofa long enough to seat three, and
two armchairs. I assumed Asuna and I would take the chairs, but
Lind motioned us toward the sofa, so we followed his lead.
Lind and Hafner sat in the armchairs, and Shivata stood to the
side. I wasn’t sure if they’d decided to have us sit down and then
leave one of their own standing as psychological pressure, or if it
was just a coincidence.
Abruptly, Hafner said, “Shivata and I explained what happened
with the fifth-floor boss to Lind. Including the reason you wanted
to get a jump start on the boss, and the reason we decided to
participate.”
I blinked twice in surprise and said, rather foolishly, “Oh. You
did?”
When Shivata and Hafner decided to join our impromptu raid
party, they hadn’t said anything to Lind, their guild master, about
it. I figured we’d either keep that a secret today or use that
revelation as the starting point—but it seemed they’d already
saved us the trouble.
At that point, we could probably just jump right into it, but
Asuna, sitting to my right, shot Shivata a look. I followed her
eyesight and saw that the short-haired swordsman was giving us
some kind of very awkward signal with his eyes.
53|P

I squinted, trying to figure out what message he was trying to
send, but Lind noticed my expression and swung around to his
right to look at Shivata. Immediately, Asuna said, “Then you must
know all about the guild flag already, Lind.”
With the mention of the item at the center of everything, Lind
turned forward again. “Yes…but only the concept. And I’ll be
honest—I’m still not sure whether to believe it or not. Before we
negotiate, I’d like to see the item first.”
The use of the word negotiate rather than discuss was ominous,
but it wasn’t enough of a reason to call things off at this stage.
“All right,” I said, opening my menu. But before I materialized
the item, I decided to set up a safety measure.
First, I went to my equipment mannequin and dragged the icon
for the Sword of Eventide +3 from my right-hand slot to my
inventory. I’d removed my equipment before we walked into the
building, so this action changed nothing about my appearance.
Next, I chose the Flag of Valor from the weapon category of my
inventory and dropped it onto my mannequin. It was a twohanded weapon, so the spear icon appeared in both my right- and
left-hand slots. Light glowed in my hands before sharpening into
the long narrow weapon—er, flag.
When pulling weapons out of item storage, simply choosing to
materialize it would pop the item into existence above the
window. But if you were equipping it, the weapon appeared in
one of two places.
If you had your weapon location selected ahead of time—for a
polearm, it was on your back by default—it would appear directly
in that spot. But if the setting was still in its initial state, or if you
didn’t have enough physical space to fit it, the item would appear
in your hands instead. Because I had my hands resting atop the
window, Lind’s group wouldn’t be able to tell if I’d just brought
the guild flag out as a simple item—or if I was equipping it.
The moment he caught sight of the ten-foot platinum
longspear, Lind’s eyes bulged. The butt of the spear reached
nearly to the window, while the tip crossed Asuna’s knees and
jutted out over the end of the sofa. The top quarter of the pole was
wrapped in a white cloth, and the string that held it in place was
54|P

silver. Its stats as a weapon were frankly unimpressive, but the
finely carved detail in the handle, the beautiful edging of the flag
fabric—the overall informational “weight” of all that detailed
data—made it clear this was a special item.
If I’d just taken the flag out in one single step, Lind could grab it
and run out of the room. If he escaped for five minutes while
Shivata and Hafner prevented me from utilizing the Materialize
All Items command, ownership of the flag would transfer to him.
But because I had equipped it first, my period of automatic
ownership lasted for a full hour.
I gave the chances of them attempting such a stunt no more
than 0.1 percent, but Lind merely tapped the pole to bring up the
properties window, read it closely, sighed, and handed it back. He
waited for me to put it back into my inventory, then leaned back
in his seat and grumbled.
“Yes…I see…Seems like quite the balance-breaking item to
have shown up on just the fifth floor…”
“I don’t know just how well it works without trying it, though,”
I admitted.
The guild master shrugged. “The listed properties won’t be
false. A hundred feet in diameter with four different buffs…Just
from that alone, it’s almost too powerful to be real. I don’t blame
Kibaou for trying to slip past the rest of us to get it—even if I find
him obnoxious.”
He didn’t seem as angry as I imagined he might be. Asuna had
the same impression.
“Did you already talk with the ALS?” she asked.
“No, we’ve said nothing. I had a toast with Kibaou at the party
last night, but I wasn’t aware of the existence of this flag at the
time,” Lind said, a self-deprecating curl present at the corner of
his mouth. He looked to the side, where Hafner was scratching his
head guiltily.
That would mean Lind had only heard the explanation in the
last few hours. So perhaps the fact that he was so calm and cool
about it was a sign that, like Kibaou, as long as the other guild
didn’t have it, he was fine with the matter. I certainly prayed so.

55|P

“Well, now that you’ve seen it for yourself, I’m going to explain
the conditions under which I would hand it over,” I continued.
“Naturally, they’re the same conditions I gave the ALS. Situation
one is if another guild flag drops somewhere. If it’s going to
happen, I’m sure either the ALS or DKB will get it this time, so in
this event, I would hand the flag to whichever guild did not get the
drop, free of any charge. Situation two is if the ALS and DKB
merge guilds. If that happens, I will hand over the flag
unconditionally.”
When I’d suggested these to the ALS in the fifth-floor boss
chamber, they’d yelled at me: That’ll never happen! and You gotta
be joking! But Lind might’ve known about them already, because
he barely batted an eye.
Instead, he asked me a very curious question. “Kirito, in the
beta test, you failed to beat the tenth-floor boss, correct?”
“Uh…yeah, that’s right. The labyrinth was this traditional
Japanese-style place called the Castle of a Thousand Serpents. We
only got partway through it.”
“And the guild flag did not drop from any more bosses to that
point?”
“It didn’t…I believe.”
“Right,” Lind murmured. “So that would mean it’s highly likely
that situation one cannot happen until at least the tenth floor…”
I nodded. If it dropped on the fifth floor, it seemed like the
tenth would be a good bet, but there was no use making
guarantees. At this point, I wished that we’d tried a bit harder in
the beta and actually beaten the tenth-floor boss, but there was no
whining about that now. Besides, the monsters in the Castle of a
Thousand Serpents—especially the snake samurai Orochi Elite
Guard and the snake ninja Kuchina Elite Assassin—were
devastatingly powerful, and just the thought that if we kept going
we’d be forced to fight them one day soon sent a chill down my
back. I didn’t even want to imagine the floor boss who ruled over
them.
Man, I could really go for a cup of hot green tea, I thought,
waiting for him to continue. But Lind did not comment on the
feasibility of the second option. He opened his window. I watched
56|P

his hand movements out of an abundance of caution, but what he
brought out was not a weapon but an extremely large leather
sack.
He grabbed it off the top of the window and set it down on the
low table. It made a heavy, metallic scraping sound.
“There’s three hundred thousand col in there,” Lind announced
to our astonishment. “It’s the most the DKB can give you at this
moment. Will you sell the guild flag to us at that price?”
Later—much, much later—Asuna would chuckle and say to
me, “If you had immediately agreed to sell it, I would’ve grabbed
the bag of money and chucked it through the window.”
But in that moment, I stared at the leather sack on the table,
unable to respond. I wasn’t stunned by the sheer presence of
300,000 in col presented to me, and I wasn’t trapped between the
options of selling or not selling. No, my mind was swept up in a
sudden flash to the past.
It was about a month ago: the evening of December 2, 2022. I
remembered the date because it was the day of the first bossstrategy meeting in the first-floor town of Tolbana, and it was the
day I met Asuna for the very first time, deep in the labyrinth—
though the memory that came to mind was unrelated to either of
those events.
Through Argo the Rat, the information agent, someone made
an offer to buy my Anneal Blade +6. The offer was for 29,800 col,
which was upped to 39,800 a few hours later.
The Anneal Blade had two upgrade attempts left—meaning I’d
gotten it to +6 without failing—which made it quite valuable at
the time, but at most, it was worth thirty-five thousand.
Suspicious, I doubled Argo’s silence fee from five hundred col to
one thousand, and she revealed that her client was none other
than Kibaou. I was even more skeptical after that, but it wasn’t
until the middle of the first-floor boss battle that I realized Kibaou
had been a go-between, too.
The man who was actually attempting to buy the Anneal Blade
was Diavel the knight, leader of SAO’s first raid party. His idea was
not to power himself up, but to power me down, allowing him to

57|P

score the last attack bonus on the boss and cement his position as
the leader of the game.
But Illfang the Kobold Lord’s attack pattern had changed
completely since the beta, and as a former beta tester like me,
Diavel fell into a trap set by his own past knowledge and
expectations, and he perished.
Despite his outward distance, Kibaou had revered Diavel
enough to take on the dirty work of buying someone else’s
weapon for him in secret. Lind had been his faithful, dedicated
party member. They both wanted to take over his position, but
their significant discrepancies in ideals led them to start their
own guilds, which were now the two biggest in the game.
The 300,000 col on the table now was ten times the sum that
Diavel offered for my Anneal Blade. That had to be a coincidence;
Lind wouldn’t have known about what Diavel was doing in secret.
If I ever found myself sharing drinks with Kibaou, I’d have to ask
him why he took on that request from Diavel, and what he
thought about it…
I emerged from my brief reverie, looked Lind right in the face,
and shook my head. “No…I wouldn’t sell this for even ten times
that much. Besides, the ALS would string me up for doing it, and I
mean that literally…Plus, let’s be real. You didn’t actually think I
was going to say yes, did you?”
The guild leader shrugged and said simply, “Not really. But it’s
important to put it out there. If you were actually willing to sell it,
it would be worth it, and if you refuse, I get you on record as
saying that you can’t be bought with cash.”
“Ah, I see what you mean. But if we’re talking a hundred
times…maybe thirty million col could convince me to— Huk!”
I finished my sentence in some strange demihuman dialect
thanks to Asuna reaching over with a smug expression and
spearing me in the side with her hand. Lind did not react, but both
Hafner and Shivata rolled their eyes.
I cleared my throat and got back to the subject at hand. “At any
rate, may I conclude that the DKB accept and understand the
terms for receiving the item now?”

58|P

“Yes…I shall have to acknowledge the current situation as the
most reasonable compromise. I do not wish for the standoff
between us and the ALS to get worse, either. But after having seen
its stats for myself, it’s a terrible shame that we can’t use the guild
flag in the next boss fight.”
“I agree. We’ll try to think of a way to put it to use, and I’m
always looking out for ideas, so send me a message if you think of
something.”
“Understood.”
At that, Lind and Hafner rose to their feet. I was going to watch
them go, but then I remembered that it was the DKB who rented
this room, so I got up in a hurry.
We filed out of the room in a line, and then Lind turned back
toward me. “By the way…are the other inns outfitted with these
obnoxious puzzles?”
“Your answer is half yes, half no,” I said, grinning. Lind looked
skeptical. “I mean, it’s not just the inns. The NPC shops, the
houses, the other locations…Aside from the front doors, every
door to every room in this town has a puzzle on it. So have fun
with that.”
I patted the stunned brush master on the shoulder and hurried
down the stairs.

59|P

“…WELL, THAT WRAPPED UP A LOT QUICKER THAN I thought it
would,” Asuna said once we were a fair distance away from the
Pegasus Hoof. Something in her tone suggested disappointment.
“Are you saying you’d have preferred if we argued over it
more…?”
“Of course not, you dummy.”
The fencer brandished a fist, then glanced around before
continuing in a quieter voice, “I was expecting a more forwardthinking response. It’s not like a second flag is going to drop any
day now, so the only way for us to make use of it on this floor is
the second option, merging—it’s obvious to everyone. So I
figured, if anyone’s going to make the first notions toward that
end, it would be the DKB, rather than the ALS…”
“You did? Why do you say that?” I asked, sensing that both
sides were more likely to say they’d prefer going to war than
joining forces as a single group.
Asuna said, “The ALS is a group pursuing a set of ideals, and
the DKB is a group pursuing practical ends. I’m sure there’d be
some amount of reshuffling in the event of a merger, of course,
but doesn’t it seem like the DKB members would complain about
it less? It’s like they already know they’re the true model for
tackling this game, and they have the confidence to go along with
it…”
“Ahhh…Yeah, I see what you’re saying.” I looked up at the
bottom of the seventh floor, hanging a hundred yards above us.
The Aincrad Liberation Squad was obviously named for the
final goal of liberating all ten thousand—well, eight thousand
now—players who were trapped in this floating castle. But it also
felt like it contained another message: liberation from a status
quo where just fifty or sixty elite players monopolized all of the
game’s resources.
60|P

On the other hand, the name of the Dragon Knights Brigade,
whoever had thought of it, didn’t seem to have much of a
meaning. It was the typical kind of fanciful nomenclature you’d
find in any online RPG. If changing the guild name was a sticking
point in merging the two sides, Asuna was probably right that the
DKB members would have less resistance to the idea.
That was why she’d been hoping that the DKB would display
an amenability to the idea, giving us a pathway to a possible
merger. But…
“The SAO system only allows for one guild leader,” I muttered.
The footsteps next to me came to a stop. I slowed myself down
and added, “Even if we could get merger negotiations on the table,
neither Lind nor Kibaou would want to give up leadership in the
end. Because both of them believe he’s the one carrying on in
Diavel’s footsteps.”
“…In that case—!”
I was startled by her vehemence and looked over to my right.
Asuna was standing there, her hands clenched into fists, staring
down at the eight-inch tiles beneath her feet.
“…In that case, why do they leave all the truly dangerous jobs
to you? They squabble over these pointless things like ideas and
pride, and they always leave you to pay the tab for them. That’s
not what a leader does.”
It was a statement very similar to what she said in the boss
chamber yesterday. And I couldn’t give her a response that was
any different.
“They’re not forcing it onto me. It’s because I stuck my neck
where it didn’t belong that I have the guild flag now. And really,
I’m more sorry that I dragged you into all of this…”
After I’d made that point yesterday, Asuna had cried.
But today, she did not. She looked up, her hazel-brown eyes
strong and determined. When she spoke, her voice was quiet but
solid to its core.
“You can’t be that flippant about this anymore. The man in the
black poncho attacked you last night because you were
preventing him from making the ALS and DKB fight, didn’t he? In
fact, it’s more than that…I’m betting that he wanted to steal the
61|P

guild flag from you, too. It’s the perfect tool for turning the
frontline players against one another.”
“What…? How would the information be getting out that fast?
The only people who knew I had the guild flag at that point were
the ones who took part in the boss fight with us, and the main
members of the ALS…”
And that was when I put it together. The ALS didn’t just have
Morte the ax wielder, whom I fought on the third floor. They very
likely had other members of the black poncho’s PK gang
infiltrating their ranks. Which meant the info about the guild flag
was being passed right along to them.
The ALS was a bit behind the DKB in terms of member level
and equipment stats, and they were trying to make up for it by
swelling their ranks. Their practice of having a recruiting team
that proactively brought in players who wanted to join the top
group was admirable, but it also made the guild vulnerable to
infiltration by those with ill intent.
It was occurring to me that it’d be smart to get both guilds’
leadership together so I could share info about the existence of
this PK gang. I shifted gears from my initial denial. “Actually, you
might be right about that. But that just makes it more important
that I don’t foist the flag off on someone else. I already have a
decent idea of how they’re doing this, and I’ve got some
experience fighting players from the beta…”
Asuna sucked in a sharp breath but let it out after just a
second, long and slow. Then she turned away—fingers brushing
the silver rapier hanging at her left side. “And now that I’ve
learned the basics of dueling from you, I have a duty to fight them
as well.”

62|P

63|P

“What?! N-no, that wasn’t my point…”
“Well, I’ve decided!” she declared, letting go of the rapier and
jabbing her finger at my chest. Like that, my temporary partner
gave me my orders: “Listen up! You’re not going to rush off
without a word to me again, the way you did when you went
searching for Argo on the fourth floor! You must be within my
sight for all twenty-four hours. Is that understood?!”
“Whehh?!”
It felt like she was treating me like a preschooler, but Asuna’s
expression was anything but joking. I opened and shut my mouth
a few times to no avail. At last, I protested, “B-but what about
when we stay at an inn…?”
To my surprise, Asuna already had an answer for that. Before
this point, she’d probably get all red in the face and physically
attack me, but now she not only didn’t hesitate or stammer, she
had an instant response.
“So we’ll rent a two-bedroom suite like the last one. If we split
the cost, it shouldn’t end up being too bad.”
“………Ah, r-right…”
I didn’t really have any other option.
“Good!” Asuna said like a pleased schoolteacher. She turned on
her heel and started walking loudly across the tiles. Within three
steps, she stopped and turned back to me again. “Also…where are
we going now?”
“Um…”
I looked around. We were on a small path to the east of the
central street of Stachion that ran north and south from the
teleport square. Although it was a backstreet, it was wide, with a
strip of greenery on the right side of the path and a row of tiny
shops on the left. Some were restaurants, as evidenced by the
fragrant smells tickling my nose.
“……How about we get lunch first, then hit up the lord’s
mansion?” I suggested.
Asuna agreed, smiling again at last. “Good idea. I’d like to eat
something that seems appropriate for the New Year holiday.”
“That…might be tough…”

64|P

But on the inside, I was running through my memory, trying to
remember if the menus of the restaurants here had anything that
fit the season.
We had a lunch of meatloaf and shrimp fritters, which might be
very generously interpreted as a Western-style take on Japanese
osechi cuisine for New Year’s Day. Then we headed up the gentle
staircase road north until we arrived at the mansion that
overlooked the rest of Stachion.
Behind the mansion was the outer perimeter of Aincrad itself,
so the pale blue expanse was very close at hand. If you turned 180
degrees at the large front gate, you saw the rectangular town
before you, followed in the distance by the wilderness of the sixth
floor.
“…When you see it all like this, you realize that six miles across
really is a huge amount of space…” Asuna remarked. I was about
to tell her that Aincrad was cone-shaped, and that each floor was
about two hundred feet narrower than the one before, but then I
realized it wasn’t really important enough to make a big deal over.
“Your typical open-world RPG’s map is around six to twelve
miles long in each direction, so it’s like a bunch of them all stacked
atop one another. According to the legend of the Great Separation
that Kizmel mentioned, Aincrad was built out of pieces of land cut
from the continent below. Makes you wonder how big that map
must be…”
“…And in the forest elves’ legend, collecting the six keys and
opening the Sanctuary will return Aincrad to the land,” Asuna
said. It brought back all the details of the “Elf War” quest’s
background.
“And the dark elves said that opening the Sanctuary will cause
Aincrad to fall to ruin…right? We definitely want to avoid things
getting ruined, but I’d also rather not have it all go back to the
earth. What if this map was suddenly dozens or hundreds of times
larger? It’s hard to stay motivated to keep going that way.”
“Wouldn’t you be able to skip having to do each and every
labyrinth—and just jump straight ahead to the final boss’s
dungeon?”
65|P

“Oh, good point…but there’s no way you could beat him…”
For an instant, I started to imagine the final boss waiting on the
hundredth floor, as Akihiko Kayaba had said on the first day of
our imprisonment. Then I shook my head to dispel the vision.
“C’mon, let’s go inside. We’ll get the quests from the lord and
try to finish all the ones in town by the end of the day.”
Cylon, the lord of Stachion, was a small and skinny man who
looked simply dreadful in his magnificent beard and flashy toga.
He didn’t put on airs, however; he was quite welcoming to these
strangers who showed up at his door. In fact, we had to wait
awhile outside his chamber because there were three groups of
players in line already, but that wasn’t his fault. They even served
us tea.
Cylon’s appearance and background story were exactly the
same as in the beta, but it was still worth paying attention for a
refresher.
According to him, the abundance of puzzles all over the town
was the result of a curse placed upon the previous lord.
His name was Pithagrus, and he was a man who loved numbers
and puzzles. He bragged day and night that there was no puzzle
he could not solve. One day, a traveler visiting his mansion
produced an exceedingly complex numerical puzzle, and
Pithagrus could not solve it. In his rage, he picked up a nearby
golden cube and beat the traveler to death with it. The traveler’s
last breath was a curse, and ever since then, Stachion was
possessed by puzzles of all kinds…
“Pithagrus was driven mad by this, and he left Stachion
forever, carrying only the bloodstained golden cube with him. It
has been ten years already since then…I suspect he is no longer
among the living,” Cylon said, sipping his tea dejectedly.
“As Pithagrus’s senior apprentice,” he continued, “I took on the
responsibilities of his office and worked my hardest to undo the
curse the murdered traveler enacted, but the puzzles only grow—
a new one appears in the town every day. Nearly all the town’s
interior doors and storage boxes are afflicted by puzzles already,
and their front doors will not be long. By that point, it will no
66|P

longer be possible for us to live here…Good swordsman, please
find the golden cube that Pithagrus took from this mansion and
bring it back. If the cube is placed on the traveler’s grave, and
prayers are dedicated to his memory, the curse of the puzzles will
surely be undone. Please, please save Stachion from this menace!”
Cylon bowed deeply, causing a golden ! to appear over his
head. Asuna glanced at me and said, “Very well. We accept your
request.”
It promptly turned into a ? at that point. Next came the time for
questions, but since we knew other players were in line to get
their quests, we kept it to a minimum, then scurried out of the
guest room. After that, we took a quick tour of the mansion, which
was still very video game–like, thanks to its cubic construction.
Lastly, we headed out into the backyard to say a quick prayer at
the grave of the traveler who’d been killed by the previous lord.
“Ahhh…Going into mansions like that, I always want to just
rifle through all the bookshelves and drawers and pots and stuff,”
I said, stretching my back.
Asuna made an exaggerated show of pulling away in disgust.
“Ew…Is that your fetish, Kirito…?”
“What?! F-first of all, it’s not a fetish, and second of all, it’s an
RPG staple that you go around ransacking people’s houses for
items! Although, in a lot of the Western ones, the guards will
chase you if you do…”
For three seconds, Asuna greeted my protestation with an even
more suspicious look. Then she burst into giggles. “Well, I
suppose you’re not the type to go sneaking around and taking
stuff. You’d rather dump out the owner’s entire inventory right in
front of their face.”
“I—I don’t recall doing any such…”
Then I remembered when I had Asuna materialize all of her
belongings on the second floor, and I suddenly had to clear my
throat.
“…thing with malice. My point is, let’s get cracking on these
quests. The “Curse of Stachion” is a really long quest series, so if
we don’t do them quickly, we could get left behind at the boss

67|P

battle. And on top of that, we’ve got more ‘Elf War’ quests on this
floor.”
“I’m more interested in those, to be honest. Between all the
murdered travelers and missing lords, the local story seems a bit
dark.”
“As a general rule, RPG quests tend not to be fun and delightful
affairs,” I commented. But the truth was that I wanted to see
Kizmel again as soon as possible. On the other hand, the longer a
quest series was, the better the experience bonus you received.
High-risk, high-return experience gains were tough to pull off—
the last thing anyone wanted was to die—so diligently checking
off quests was still the quickest way to level up.
Asuna suddenly tossed her arms into the air and stretched like
she was doing morning calisthenics. “Okay, let’s do this! Where
are we going first?” she exclaimed.
“To an old man who was the butler to the old lord—to ask him
questions,” I answered. Her excitement meter visibly plummeted.
“Ugh, that’s so boring…and we’re going to have to wait at the
entrance again, aren’t we…?”
“Shall we buy some ring puzzles to play with while we wait?”
“No, thanks.”
The fencer shook her head sadly and trudged off. I trotted after
her.
The former butler’s house was at the very southern end of
Stachion, completely across town. If the northern half was the
luxurious side with its ample greenery, the southern half was the
more urban side, with small houses clustered around cramped
alleys. Most of the buildings were made of wood—but eight-inch
wooden blocks rather than boards and pillars—so they looked
more like life-size block houses.
Fortunately, there were no other players at our destination,
and we were done talking to the elderly NPC in just over ten
minutes and on our way.
His story was the same as it had been in the beta. The former
butler wasn’t present for the murder of the traveler; he heard the
screams and rushed to the master’s chamber, only to see the
68|P

ghastly body. The way he described it, the head was beaten to a
pulp, and the humble traveling garb was covered in blood. In the
beta, people had muttered, “This quest has to be rated R!”
The butler had no leads on the location of Pithagrus or the
golden cube, but rather predictably, he did say that the
maidservant at the time might know something. So we headed to
the servant’s home next.
As we walked the narrow path, Asuna brought up a very
reasonable question. “Say…don’t you know the final destination
for this quest already, Kirito? Couldn’t we just skip all these steps
and go right there?”
“Actually…you can’t. If you don’t go in order, things break
down. Characters won’t talk to you, and events won’t happen. If
we hadn’t talked to Cylon first, that old man back there probably
wouldn’t have let us into his home.”
“…And how many more people do we need to talk to in town,
by the way?”
“Six.”
She abruptly blurted, “Falyoon!”
“…What was that?”
“I was saying, ‘I much prefer the generic monster-killing quests
to manhunt quests,’ in Elvish!”
“Nga-grunga.”
“…What was that?”
“‘I completely agree,’ in Orcish.”
And on and on, we chatted and joked as we made our way
across Stachion to the home of the maidservant who’d happily
married her way out of the job (they didn’t actually say that).
From there, we went to the former gardener, then cook, then
first apprentice, then second apprentice, then favorite bartender,
until at last we got the piece of information that Pithagrus owned
a separate home in a neighboring town. That was the end of the
questline in Stachion for the moment.
As we left the pub, the sky from the outer aperture was
reddish-purple. It was five thirty in the afternoon by then, largely
because at a number of these quest stops, the people had errands
of their own to do.
69|P

Asuna stretched. She looked tired. “So after all that…we didn’t
learn very much. Pithagrus was an eccentric, but everyone seems
to admire him, and he didn’t have a wife or children. That was it, I
think? And nobody knows who the murdered traveler was—or
where they were from…”
“Well, that’s not so strange, now, is it? If you’re a traveler here,
you don’t have a passport or social media accounts to follow.”
“But the teleporters weren’t active ten years ago, so if it’s a
traveler, they came from somewhere on the sixth floor, right?” she
wondered, looking up. “There are maybe three or four other
villages here, so if we wanted to track them down, it should be
possible to identify them, don’t you think…?” At that, she stared
straight at me.
“Wh-what?”
“Hang on…you know the ending to this quest, don’t you?
Where did Pithagrus go? Who was the traveler?”
“Um…you’re really gonna ask that question?”
Whether it was online multiplayer or not, a game’s story was a
sensitive area when it came to spoilers. Some people didn’t care at
all, and some people got furious over it. Survival was the utmost
priority in SAO, of course, and Asuna didn’t seem the type to get
hung up on spoilers, but I’d been careful to not reveal the
outcome of quests before we got to them.
After a brief look of surprise, Asuna realized what I meant by
that and let out a little giggle. “Ohhh, so you’ve been holding back
for my sake! Well, it’s all right. I don’t get all worked up about this
sort of quest.”
“Um…this sort of quest…? Then what sort of quest would you
get upset about—over spoilers?”
“The heartwarming ones and the tear-jerking ones.”
“……”
Out of all the quests we’d done together, which ones would she
classify as heartwarming and which as tear-jerking? And what
category did the “Curse of Stachion” fall under? After a few
seconds, I came to the conclusion that it was pointless to try to
figure it out.

70|P

“…Um, so am I correct in thinking that you won’t get mad if I
tell you the ending of this quest?”
“No worries. It’s totally one of the disappointing kinds, right?”
“……”
I hated to admit it, but she was right. After all the trouble I
went through to finish it in the beta, I was left with such a bad
aftertaste that I wanted a word with the scenario writer.
“Okay, then I’m going to spoil the hell out of it…There was
never any traveler to begin with.”
“Huh?!” Asuna yelped. She came to a stop and turned toward
me. “No traveler…? But the butler and the maidservant saw the
body, right? And the gardener dug the hole for the grave in the
backyard. So who was it that got killed and buri…? Oh!”
She stopped herself in a moment of epiphany. I gave her a little
round of applause.
“Bingo. That was the body of Pithagrus, the former lord. And
the one who killed him was…”
“……Cylon?”
“Bingo again. Cylon was the first apprentice of Pithagrus the
puzzle king, but when he announced that a different apprentice
would take over as his true heir, he got furious and beat his
master to death. To hide his crime, he pulverized the face until it
was unrecognizable, then put on shabby clothes to transform
himself into a made-up traveler…”
“I knew it! I knew it!” she shouted abruptly, hands on her hips
with her face thrust forward. “I knew it was going to be a
disappointing one! That’s why I don’t like this kind of quest! And
what’s the ‘puzzle king’ supposed to mean anyway? What do you
get by being the heir to the puzzle king?!”
“D-don’t yell at me. I didn’t write it…I don’t know what they get
out of it, but there are quiz kings and medal kings and so on. Some
people just really want to have that honor, I guess?”
“It doesn’t make sense…And for that matter, I don’t know what
a medal king is supposed to be, either…”
“Sorry, forget I said it. At any rate, that’s the ending. But you
get a ton of experience for it, so let’s just tough it out and beat the
quest.”
71|P

“All right,” Asuna said, unconvinced. She looked up at the
bottom of the floor above. The lid of rock and steel was turning
deep purple, signaling that night would arrive within an hour. The
next town over was a mile away, and there wouldn’t be many
monsters along the road, so we could definitely get there before it
was dark, but the problem was the next step after that.
Pithagrus’s other home was an empty ruin now, and it would be
full of astral-type monsters (i.e., ghosts) that we’d have to fight
multiple times before we got the next clue. I decided to keep that
part a secret, clapping the fencer lightly on the shoulder.
“Let’s get dinner in the next town, and then we can continue
the quest. If we can finish it up by the end of tomorrow, we should
be able to get to the dark elf fortress the day after.”
Asuna’s face lit up, and she gave me an energetic “Great!”
Suribus, the second town on the sixth floor, was a beautiful place
with a southern European air and absolutely no little eight-inch
blocks.
A large river running through its middle was spanned by
numerous bridges—a sight that was reminiscent of Rovia, the
main town of the fourth floor—though, regrettably, this river had
not a single gondola in it. Still, the view of orange lights reflecting
off the dark surface of the water had a kind of ethereal beauty you
could only find in a virtual world. We had to stop on the bridge
leading into the town for a moment to drink it all in.
“…This town doesn’t have any cursed puzzles in it, right?”
Asuna said right off the bat.
“Nope,” I confirmed. “If you want some to go, they sell ’em in
the gift shops.”
“I don’t,” she stated firmly. “More importantly, let’s get
something to eat. What’s good in Suribus?”
“Hmm, let me think…”
In the beta, I just ran through the quests and didn’t spend
much time here, and upon further reflection, there weren’t many
opportunities to eat in Aincrad back then. If I had time, I wanted
to spend it leveling up, and if I got full in the virtual world, my

72|P

mom and sister would yell at me. I tried to dig through what dim
memories I had of the place to little effect.
“It’s a wrap bake.”
I spun around in alarm at the sound of a voice right behind us,
covering Asuna to protect her.
Leaning against the stone railing was not, however, the man in
the black poncho who’d tried to kill me the other day; it was a
small woman in a sand-brown cape. The top half of her face was
hidden behind straw-yellow curls, but there was no mistaking the
three whisker markings on either cheek.
This was the best and only source of information in Aincrad,
Argo the Rat. She looked stunned for a second, then pouted.
“What’s this? What’d I do to earn this kind of reaction from you,
Kii-boy? That hurts.”
“S-sorry…I’m kind of on edge right now. It’s Sneak Attack
Caution Week, let’s call it…”
Asuna popped out from behind my back. “Good evening, Argo!
I didn’t see you in Stachion—of course, you must’ve been over
here already.”
“Evenin’, A-chan.” Argo waved at her and pushed herself off the
railing to walk closer. “Well, I’d like ta get my first strategy guide
out by tomorrow, but it looks like most of the front-runners are
already moving from the main town here to Suribus.”
“Oh, they are? But why—?” I started to ask before the reason
occurred to me. “Oh…It’s because the puzzles are a pain in the
ass…isn’t it?”
“Hee-hee-hee! Bingo. And the monsters aren’t too tough
around these parts…so while I hate ta be the bearer of bad news,
just about all the rooms in Suribus are booked. Only the expensive
suites are available.”
Asuna and I glanced at each other. We’d been planning to stay
in a suite with two bedrooms tonight anyway, so the single rooms
being taken wasn’t a problem. But given Argo’s rather menacing
motto of “selling any info that can be sold,” this free tip was a
bit—no, make that very—suspicious.

73|P

“Ohhh, I s-see. But I’m sure that if we look, we can find an open
room or two,” I replied. Argo’s eyebrow twitched, but she said
nothing more on the matter.
“Welp…based on what you were sayin’ earlier, I’m guessin’ you
two are about to eat dinner?”
“Yes, we were just deciding what to have,” Asuna said. “Argo,
you said this town was famous for its wrap bakes? Do you have a
recommended restaurant?”
“I just made my way over here from Stachion earlier today,
actually. Only had a chance to try out one place, but it was mighty
tasty.”
“Then let’s go to that one!” Asuna insisted. Argo had no choice
but to grimace and go along with it. If it was me, she’d have
demanded a price for that intel, but now that Asuna had identified
her as a good friend, the Rat seemed unable to inflict her usual
business practices.
Argo took us to a place on the third floor of a building along the
river that ran through Suribus. It was kind of a hidden, hole-inthe-wall type establishment. The first and second floor were just
homes, and there was no sign, so you weren’t likely to find it
unless you knew about it already.
The stairs were narrow enough you could barely go two ways
on them, and the door at the end was faded and marked with
knots, but the interior of the place was quite clean. There was a
counter and two tables for four, so we took one of them.
I was imagining that the famous “wrap bake” would be
something like gyoza dumplings, but what came out was
essentially a round meat pie about eight inches across. Meat,
tomato-flavored veggies, and plenty of cheese were all wrapped
in a hot crispy crust. It wasn’t bad. In fact, it was great.
In a blink, I’d reduced the circle pie to a semicircle. I took a
long drink of cold herbal tea, then asked the info dealer, “Are all
the wrap bakes in this town the same tomato-and-cheese flavor?”
“Nope. If it’s like it was in the beta, each place will serve a
different kind. Since it’s a riverside town, most of ’em were fish.”
“Fish pie…? Seems weird to me…” I murmured.

74|P

But Asuna had a huge grin on her face. “Just like the famous
herring and pumpkin pie, I suppose.”
“F-famous…?”
I craned my head back the other way, wondering if there was
such a staple dish in Aincrad, and saw that Argo was smirking as
well. “A-chan, if you’re going to make a reference a game addict is
going to understand, it has to be from a game.”
“I suppose you’re right…”
“You’ve got a lot of work ahead of you in your future…”
“No kidding…I m-mean, not that I’ve decided this partnership
is lasting forever!”
“Nee-hee-hee-hee!”
In the moment, I had the feeling that although it was hard to
tell what exactly they were talking about, it was probably better
that I didn’t know, so I returned my attention to the half-finished
meat pie.
Now that I thought of it, this might have been the first time I’d
ever tasted a truly orthodox tomato flavor in Aincrad. Food in this
world tended to be light on flavoring but heavy on spice. It was
good once you got used to it, but most restaurants had one little
thing—or sometimes a big thing—that felt unsatisfying afterward.
This pleasantly overdone tomato flavor, however, was almost
reminiscent of junk food to me. I’d have loved to try it heaped on
top of soft-boiled spaghetti rather than in a neat little pie…but I
still finished every last bite of the meal anyway.
“Ahhhh…Nice work, Argo. You know the best places to go.”
“Don’t I? Now, I’m not sayin’ ya owe me for the tip, but…”
She looked around the room, ensuring there were no other
players present, then whispered, “The big thing…How’d it all turn
out?”
Given that we were alone, it seemed like she could have just
said the name of the item in question. But it was an important
enough topic that I couldn’t get touchy about it.
I leaned over the table and whispered, quiet enough that no
Eavesdropping skill could pick it up through the door, “We gave
the DKB the same conditions we did to the ALS. They did accept
our terms, but…”
75|P

“But?”
“They also tried to buy it off us for three hundred thousand
col.”
Argo blinked once, very slowly. Her painted-on whiskers
twitched. “Heh-heh. So that’s their tactic. Well, in that case…”
“…He really is takin’ over for Diavel,” she left unsaid, downing
the rest of her herb tea. Asuna looked at us for answers, but I
whispered “I’ll explain later” before getting us back to the topic at
hand.
“At any rate, it looks like I’ll be holding on to it for the time
being. The only problem is: That means we can’t use it for this
upcoming boss fight…so they were on the same page in hoping to
find a shortcut to it.”
“A shortcut, huh…?” Argo folded her arms and murmured to
herself. Then she grinned again. “Remember what the chakram
guy who helped you with the fifth-floor boss said? If you started
up a guild, all the Legend Braves would join ya. In fact, if ya made
A-chan the leader instead of yerself, I bet you’d have a whole
crowd o’ folks lookin’ to join. How about that?”

76|P

77|P

“Wh…what?”
Just this morning, Asuna had said she didn’t want to be the
subleader of a guild. She shook her head back and forth so
violently that the ends of her long hair smacked me in the face.
“Y-you’ve got to be joking! It’s annoying enough for me to
watch after him. I want nothing to do with any guild master job!”
“A-annoying…?”
I wasn’t expecting that her answer was going to throw me
under the bus. Argo just chuckled to herself.
We said good-bye to the info dealer outside the meat-pie place
and headed right for Pithagrus’s other home on the edge of town.
The river running through Suribus was flowing from a
waterfall that emerged directly from one of the massive pillars at
the outer aperture of Aincrad, and it continued through to the
lake in the center of the floor. The town was built in a narrow
strip along both banks of the river, with countless bridges
crossing back and forth. Some of those bridges actually had full
buildings on top of them, with roofs and everything. One of these
“bridge houses” was our quest destination.
We started this day training in the dark elf camp on the third
floor, then talked with the DKB, followed by running all over town
doing quests, leaving town and fighting our first monsters in the
evening, and now reaching Suribus for dinner. Naturally, Asuna
was looking a bit fatigued, but as soon as she saw the bridge
where we were heading, her eyes lit up.
“Ooh, it’s lovely! Just like the Ponte Vecchio!”
The name sounded familiar to me, so I consulted my memories
of the real world—in danger of being entirely overwritten by that
of this fantasy realm—and asked, “Erm, are you talking
about…the bridge in that, er…famous Tokyo theme park…?”
Asuna blinked twice, then smiled. “Ah, right. They copied it
there, too, didn’t they? In the water park, not the land one. But the
original Ponte Vecchio is a bridge in Florence, Italy, spanning the
Arno River. The real one’s much bigger than this one, of course,
but it’s just as beautiful…”
She looked up at the bridge house again, enchanted, while I fell
into my thoughts. This was now the second time (ever since the
78|P

fourth floor) my temporary partner had mentioned the name of a
city in Italy. At this point, it was probably a good bet that she’d
actually been there herself—not just read about it. That on its
own wasn’t important, but it did fit a pattern, combined with her
looks, communication skills, lack of gaming knowledge, and
richness of other knowledge, that suggested Asuna had an
extremely fulfilling and “normal” life in the real world. So how did
she wind up logging into SAO on the very first day, when only ten
thousand copies had been shipped (and nine thousand turned
on), getting herself stuck in here…?
“C’mon, let’s get going! I bet the river is gorgeous from up
there!”
She patted me on the back, and I returned to my senses.
“Oh, y-yeah, I bet…”
From the outside, Pithagrus’s second mansion was pretty, but
it was a total wreck on the inside. It was also full of ghost-type
monsters, which Asuna described as “not my forte”—which
probably meant she was completely terrified of them. But before I
could explain any of that, the fencer had marched off for the
building, and the only thing I could do was chase after her.
As we traveled along the river toward the bridge, three players
were descending the stone stairs that led up to the house over the
water. On instinct, we stopped behind the trees lining the road
and listened to them speak.
“…No way that door opens…”
“Waste of time. Forget this whole thing. Three digits is bad
enough, but six is impossible!”
“Yeah, I just feel like there’s gotta be something good in
there…”
The grumbling trio passed by our position and left. From the
tree next to mine, Asuna gave me a sidelong glance.
“…Is there another puzzle door?”
“…Yes.”
“…You said they were only in the main town.”
“N-no, it’s just the one here…I think,” I added, stepping back
into the street.
79|P

The bridge that Asuna compared to Ponte Vecchio was about
eighty feet long and twenty feet wide. The first story was just a
normal bridge, but the side railings were dotted with pillars that
formed countless arches supporting the living space on the
second story. After having spent so much time in Stachion with its
uniform, blocky look, the structure here was, indeed, elegant and
attractive.
At the edge of the railing were especially large supports—the
main pillars, as they called them—the sort that often featured a
plaque with the bridge’s name on it. One had a short staircase
attached to it that led up to Pithagrus’s house over the bridge
itself. As I approached the old door, I couldn’t help but reflect that
games taught you to want to head up little paths like this.
On the surface of the stout wooden door was a six-part metal
dial. It was a familiar locking device, where each wheel could turn
through all the digits from zero to nine.
Asuna reached it first and tried it out, the dials clicking as she
moved the numbers. She turned to me. “None of the quests so far
had anyone tell us the key for a numerical lock, did they…? Are we
supposed to solve this on our own?”
“You might guess a three-digit code, but six makes it just about
impossible. It can be anything from zero to nine hundred ninetynine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine, so that’s a hundred
thousand possibilities…”
“You mean a million.”
“Huh? Oh…y-yeah, duh. A million possibilities. So even if you
just ran through each and every one, it would take you several
days. But, spoiler alert, you can find the correct combination in
Cylon’s office.”
“What? Where was it written?”
“In the landscape painting on the wall,” I said.
Asuna’s cheeks promptly puffed up. “Hey, you could have said
something. If I’d known there would be a hint there, I would have
looked closer and spotted it.”
“No, I very much doubt that. The way it works is that you’re
supposed to come here and think, ‘I don’t know the numbers!’
Then you go back to Stachion to ask Cylon, who won’t tell you, but
80|P

he makes an odd show of trying to hide the painting. So then he
kicks you out and you have to wait for him to leave before you can
go back in to search the painting. It’s a huge pain…”
“…You’re right, I’d rather not go through all that,” Asuna
admitted. Then her brows knitted again. “But…how does that
make sense? I mean, Cylon’s the—”
I had a feeling she would blurt this out at some point, so I
glanced over my shoulder and cut her off. “We can talk inside. I
don’t want anyone to see us opening the door.”
“Fine, fine, whatever you say. So…what’s the correct
combination?”
“Let’s see…”
I started to answer according to my recollection from the beta,
but my spine ran cold. If they had changed the combination
between then and the release of the game, I was about to look
extremely stupid. Hesitantly, I uttered the six digits.
“…Six, two, eight, four, nine, six.”
“Uh-huh…”
She quickly spun the little dials into place. With a very clear
click! the lock was undone. I stepped forward, relieved, but Asuna
just stared at the dials without turning the doorknob.
“What’s up? If you don’t open it soon enough, the lock will
engage again.”
“Oh…y-yeah. I was just thinking, the numbers seemed familiar
somehow. Maybe I really did spot them in the painting without
realizing it,” she said vaguely as she opened the door. It was pitchblack inside, and a draft of chilly, damp air swept outward. The
fencer fell back on her heels a bit, sensing something foreboding,
but I grabbed her shoulders from behind and kept her moving
forward.
Once we were inside, the door shut behind us on its own.
There was a scraping sound, which was just the number dials
from the lock shuffling themselves again, but I felt Asuna’s
shoulders jump under my fingers.
“…Um, it’s dark in here.”
“Yeah, it’s night.”

81|P

“…How are we going to search the place like this? Should we
wait until the morning and come back?”
“No, we’re fine.”
I opened up my window and materialized an item that I always
had on the first page of my inventory.
“Laaanterrrn,” I said in a spooky voice, hoping this would
lighten up the mood. All I got was a cold stare over Asuna’s
shoulder. I cleared my throat awkwardly and lit the device, filling
the area with orange light.
As one might expect from a home belonging to the lord of
Stachion, the entrance hall was quite spacious. Because it was
built on top of a bridge, it was inevitably a bit elongated and
narrow in shape, but the hallway that ran down the left wall was
plenty wide enough not to feel cramped.
On the other hand, there were bundles of cobwebs in the
corners of the ceiling, and broken utensils and torn pieces of
paper were all over the floor. It very much had the appearance of
an abandoned house. The look on Asuna’s face said this wasn’t
what she signed up for.
She turned to me. “So…back to what I was saying.”
“What was that…? Oh, about Cylon?”
“Yes. Does what he’s doing make any sense? If he’s the one who
killed Pithagrus and buried the body in traveler’s garb in the
backyard, why is he asking us to investigate the incident for him?”
“Nuh-uh. Cylon didn’t ask us to investigate the killing of the
traveler. He asked us to look for the golden cube that was used in
the murder.”
“Oh, right…” The small furrow between her eyebrows eased for
a moment, then returned. “No, but that still doesn’t make sense.
Cylon was the one who beat Pithagrus to death with the golden
cube, right? So wouldn’t Cylon have hidden the weapon?”
“Well, the reasoning behind that comes up at the end of the
quest…but whatever. So Cylon got mad and beat Pithagrus to
death, then mocked him up into a traveler who didn’t exist to hide
his crime, right? He thought it all worked out in the end, but
somehow the cube vanished from the murder scene—a cube with
Cylon’s bloody fingerprints on it. On top of that, it’s the town
82|P

treasure and the symbol of its lord—the very cube that formed
the sizing basis of all the stone and wood cubes that make up the
town. So Cylon’s idea is that the only way to purify the puzzle
curse upon Stachion is to find the missing cube, clean off his
prints, then place it at the grave of the traveler…who is secretly
Pithagrus himself.”
“……It just seems…very selfish. Or convenient. If he really
wanted to undo the puzzle curse, he shouldn’t be bothering with
the cube. He should admit that he killed Pithagrus and turn
himself in to the police, right?”
“Well, yeah. But there are no police in Aincrad.”
Asuna murmured a soft “Oh yeah,” but her indignation still
remained. She brought up the town guards, the dark elf fortress,
even Blackiron Palace down in the Town of Beginnings on the
first floor as a list of places he where he could turn himself in to a
higher authority.
“…Well?” she finished, looking at me.
“Well…what?”
“What do you think I mean? Who stole the golden cube? You’re
not going to tell me it grew arms and legs of its own and ran
away……Oh!”
“‘Oh’…what?”
“Is that actually what it is? You said the boss of this floor is like
a giant Rubik’s Cube. Did the golden cube turn into some kind of
monster form?”
Now it was my turn to be stunned. As impressed as I was with
the fencer’s imagination, I had to shake my head.
“Sadly, that is not the case. Actually, maybe it’s not sad—if that
boss cube were completely gold, you’d have no idea how to rotate
it to solve the sides. But back to the point…we’ve already met the
person who removed the cube.”
“Whaaat?” She scowled, then let her eyes wander as she
considered this. “So you’re saying…it’s one of the seven people we
talked to in Stachion? The former butler, the maidservant, the
gardener, the cook, the two apprentices, and the bartender he
liked to visit…? And one of them has the cube now? Who is it?”

83|P

“Let’s find that out on our own. We’re here to get the clues,
after all,” I said with an evil grin.
She pouted. “Fine, let’s get on with it. You know which room
has the clue in it, right?”
“Sadly, the place where the key item pops up is randomized.”
“…So we’ll just have to start with the first room and go in
order.”
The swordswoman started walking down the entrance hall. As
she went, I called out, “Oh, and a few of the rooms have ghosts, so
don’t forget to prepare for battle.”
“Sure, sure, whatever.”
Step-step-step, pause.
All of a sudden, she had teleported behind my back with her
hands on my shoulders. An unyielding force pushed me on toward
the first room.
Fortunately, like in the beta, there was no dial lock on the
inside doors. I pushed it open to a room that was actually darker
than the hallway. Even with the lantern held up, the light didn’t
reach all the corners of the room.
“…Was there a ghost?” came a tiny voice behind my back. For
the briefest of moments, my penchant for mischief kicked in, but I
knew that playing pranks here would be the end of our
partnership, so I gave her an honest answer.
“Doesn’t seem like there’s one in this room.”
“I don’t want seems! I want it on the record!”
“Fine, fine. There are no ghosts in here.”
At last, Asuna emerged from hiding behind my back, looking as
smug and in control as ever as she inspected the room. “Ew…it’s
in a terrible state…”
I had to concur. It was probably a guest parlor originally, with
a deluxe set of furniture in the middle of the moderate-sized
room, and a huge fireplace on the far wall. But all the other
furniture had collapsed after ten years of disuse, and the carpet
was eaten through by insects.
Asuna approached a side table that was still intact and ran a
finger across its surface, which was piled high with dust. She

84|P

made another face. “This was probably luxury furniture at one
point. Not much use for it anymore…”
“Well, you might be able to refurbish it if you take it to an NPC
woodworker.”
“Wait, you can do that? I thought you couldn’t move the objects
in an NPC’s home.”
“As a general rule. But in these safe-zone dungeons, there are a
fair number of furniture pieces whose coordinates aren’t locked,”
I explained, moving next to Asuna and grabbing the side table
with both hands. When I pulled upward, the legs came right off
the ground.
“There, you see?”
“You’re right…Hmm. But even if it got fixed up, I don’t think I’d
want to use furniture that came from a place like this. For one
thing, I have no idea when I might ever have a place of my own.”
“Yeah, that’s a good point,” I said, lowering the table. But that
vibration, as tiny as it was, managed to do in its remaining
durability, and it crumbled pathetically into a pile of wood.
“Ooooh, you busted it—you’re in trouble!” Asuna teased me,
grinning wolfishly. She leaned onto the back of a nearby threeseat sofa, and instantly, the legs cracked off. It finished its act by
splitting in two, through both the seat and the back portion.
“Ooh, I’m gonna tell the teacher!” I taunted back, which I didn’t
think I’d said even when I was actually in elementary school.
Asuna snorted and grinded her left fist against my side. I couldn’t
very well return that jab, and it left me helpless to do anything but
grind my teeth in frustration.
“There doesn’t seem to be anything else here. Let’s go to the
next one,” I said, pointing at the door.
“Fine, if you say so…but what are we even looking for
anyway?”
“Something that would suggest the location of the golden
cube.”
“And what is that something…? Well, if it’s the key to this quest,
I bet they’ll make sure it’s visible one way or another.”
“Let’s hope so…” I said knowingly as I headed into the hallway.
I checked the front door just in case, but it didn’t seem to have
85|P

been opened while we were in the parlor. Asuna checked the
same direction and seemed to notice something, however.
“Hey…what happens if someone else solves the combination
on the dials while we’re already in here?”
“It’s not an instanced location. So they’d come right in here.”
“…And what happens if that person finds the clue item before
we do?”
“I’d say that the item would be locked in place so you can’t
move or destroy it, or it would be something you could find
infinitely. But in the latter case, it would spawn at certain
intervals. There are some that take thirty minutes or an hour to
reappear. Some even last as long as a day before they come
back…”
“Then we’d better find it and get out of here. C’mon, next,
next!”
Asuna pushed me several steps down the hallway until we
came to a new door.
The room adjacent to the parlor was a large dining room. The
massive dinner table and chairs were still intact, but the way that
ten or so table settings with cutlery included were laid out on top
was quite eerie. The wine bottles and candleholders were gray
with dust, and the chandelier hanging from the ceiling supported
many spiderwebs.
For five seconds, Asuna cowered behind my back. Once she
was certain there were no ghosts here, she emerged as if nothing
had just happened.
“Can you move the wine and utensils, too?” she asked.
“Probably. You wanna take that back and drink it?”
“No, thank you. On the other hand, the clue item doesn’t seem
to be here, either,” she murmured. Asuna strode closer to the
dining table.
Just then, there was a whooshing, rustling sound like the kind
we heard in the underground chapel on the fifth floor, and a pale
light spilled out from beneath the table. Passing up through the
filthy tablecloth were two astral monsters—based on the long,
slim silhouettes and tattered white dresses, they seemed to be
wraiths. There were other kinds in this category—specters,
86|P

phantoms, spirits, apparitions—but I honestly had no idea what
differentiated them all.
While she didn’t scream the way she had on the floor below,
Asuna leaped upward a foot or so and ran through the air—at
least it seemed that way to me because she was moving so fast—
and darted around behind my back again.
“Th-there they are! Hurry! Do something!” she ordered. I drew
my Sword of Eventide +3, but rather than immediately attacking, I
kept the wraiths at bay with the tip.
“Asuna, I think it’s for the best if you experience some battle
against astral types right here.”
“B-but…”
“It’s all right. You might have forgotten, but we’re in town now.
No matter how much they attack, you won’t lose a single pixel of
HP.”
That’s not the problem, she seemed to say with her resulting
sigh. But Asuna had thoughts of her own on this, and she peered
around my left shoulder. While she immediately shrank back first,
she then sidled her entire body until she was at my side instead.
With her lantern held high in her off-hand, she drew the Chivalric
Rapier +7 and pointed it at the wraiths situated atop the table.
I focused on the ghosts myself, bringing up the automatic
cursor. Beneath the HP bar, it said ANNOYING WRAITH in English,
and the cursor itself was a very faint pink color. That meant that
even if we weren’t in town, they wouldn’t be tough foes.
“…I don’t recall seeing any ‘Annoying’ Wraiths before,” Asuna
said, her voice a bit hoarse.
As calmly as I could, I asked her, “What’s anoing mean?”
“You didn’t learn that in English class? It’s, like, irritating—or
troublesome…”
“Ahh. That would fit for a quest event like this. Like I said,
we’re in town, so we won’t lose any HP. But aside from that, these
are the same as any ordinary wraith, so hitting their limbs or the
end of their dresses won’t do much damage, and if they hit you,
they can debuff you.”

87|P

“Wait…you never warned me about that!” Asuna shrieked, and
the wraiths seemed to react to the sound. They spread their arms
and descended with a wail: “Hyoooo!”
Human-type astral monsters could be male, female, or
indeterminate, but wraiths were mostly female, it seemed.
However, they had no beauty whatsoever; the arms extending
from their ragged dresses were thin as bones, and two-thirds of
their faces were skeletal. Blue fires burned in the eye sockets of
these ones, and they swung long hands with knife-sharp nails.
I evaded the first attack and swiped at the torso. The deep cut
produced a white substance like smoke, but it left little impact,
and the wraith only lost a tenth of its health bar.
But the creature screeched hideously and flew to the corner of
the dining room. I kept my sword pointed in its direction and
glanced over to check on Asuna.
“Why, you! Fngh! Shwaaa!” the fencer was hissing, not to be
outdone by the wraiths’ bizarre vocalizations. She executed thrust
skills with incredible speed—their frequency so thick that even
the ghost couldn’t get past her rapier. As the wraith flew around
in a figure-eight pattern, she occasionally clipped an arm, but it
didn’t do much HP damage.
Astral types had insubstantial bodies, and regular weapons did
not inflict effective damage on them. Other games would have
flame or light spells that could wreak havoc on them, but because
of the ancient Great Separation of Aincrad, true magic had been
lost here. You just had to make do with physical attacks, one way
or another.
The most common method was to place a blessing buff on your
weapon, but at the moment, that could only be done in large
towns with a church, and it cost money. You could also use sword
skills with a high anti-astral effect (most of which were mace or
flail skills) or bring many illumination items (astral monsters’
natural resistance was lower in the light), but these were tough
requirements for a group of just two sword users.
Fortunately, both Asuna’s Chivalric Rapier and my Sword of
Eventide had received elven upkeep, which gave them minor
effectiveness against the undead—enough to be good on its own
88|P

against weak event monsters like these. I thrust my lantern
forward and closed the gap so I could take my target out. In this
situation, a fighter who used a shield or a two-handed weapon
would just have to put the light on the ground to fight, but having
a free hand meant I could just hold the lantern. And to get even
more into the fine details, not only did having a light equipped in
battle help with attacking power, a torch was better because it
didn’t count as irregular equipment—and it had extra power
against an astral foe weak to fire—with the only drawback being
that you had to be careful swinging it around indoors, lest you
accidentally burn something that could be destroyed.
Lit by the yellow light of the lantern, the Annoying Wraith let
out a high-pitched wail and slid to the right to get away. But that
was just what I wanted; when it got into range, I used the threepart skill Sharp Nail on it.
The strongest sword skills I had at the moment were the fourparters Horizontal Square and Vertical Square, which unlocked at
proficiency level 150, but they were too wide-ranging for an
indoor environment like this. If push came to shove, I couldn’t
bother myself about not destroying the walls or furniture, but
since this was in an anti-crime code area, and there were plenty of
unbreakable objects around, I didn’t want to have my sword
bounce off an obstacle and lose my skill combo.
Sharp Nail, however, was a nice, compact trio of strikes with
the same high-angle path. My silver-glowing sword sank into the
torso of the Annoying Wraith without catching on the wall or
ceiling.
The first and second hits took it down to about a third of its
health, but the last one seemed unlikely to finish the job.
Yet, the moment the third erupted, the tip of the Sword of
Eventide actually veered away, as if drawn by a magnet. It sliced
the wraith’s shoulder, passed expertly through the center of the
chest, then emerged out the side. Unlike the first two slices, this
one came with the sensation of something small and hard
breaking.
Counter to my expectations, the wraith’s HP bar sank into the
red zone and did not stop until it reached zero. The three visual
89|P

slicing marks hung in the air like some fierce beast’s claws,
overlapped by the usual blue bursting effect of any dying monster.
I stared at the blade of my second-generation sword, still in the
pose with which I finished the swing.
That magnetic sensation I’d gotten was undoubtedly the
aiming-adjustment system that the Accuracy boost had given my
weapon. I’d thought the effect only kicked in when you
intentionally aimed at a weak point, but I had no idea that a
wraith-type monster had a little solid nodule in its chest as a vital
area, so that meant the Sword of Eventide had basically hit the
Annoying Wraith right in that spot of its own volition.
“…Is that true?” I asked it in a tiny voice. The sword didn’t
reply, of course.
What I did hear, instead, was my partner screaming.
“Uniiiieee!”
It was probably an expression of disgust and frustration. I
turned to see, on the other side of the large dining room, the
fencer utilizing a sword skill. It was the best move she had at the
moment, Triangular.
A clean hit from that skill, with the power of the Chivalric
Rapier +7, would be enough to take out half my HP. It riddled the
wraith with near-invisible speed. But the enemy rose right before
the skill executed, meaning it only hit the trailing skirt portion.
That ectoplasmic white smoke tattered in its wake, but it left the
HP bar with 30 percent remaining.
“Hoh-hoh-hooohhh…” the wraith cried—somewhere between
a scream and a mocking laugh—and swung its long arms at Asuna
as she waited to recover from the skill delay. It didn’t do any
damage, but Asuna’s HP bar lit up with an icon of a pale hand.
That was the Chillness debuff that lowered body temperatures
uncomfortably.
“Fyah!” Asuna raged, leaping back as soon as she could move
again. Despite valiantly holding her sword aloft, her shivering was
apparent. Chill did no actual damage, but it was a major
annoyance, causing sneezes in battle and keeping you from
dodging the enemy’s attack.
I rushed up behind her and called out, “Asuna, want h…?”
90|P

“No!” she snapped, refusing my aid. She was not entirely going
to handle it on her own, however. “Just give me a hint or
something! Its HP refuses to go down!”
“Oh…yeah, rapier thrusts are just about the worst kind of
attack to use against astrals…”
The Annoying Wraith floating up near the ceiling couldn’t have
understood what I was saying, but it chose a very appropriate
moment to chuckle.
“Asuna, have you mastered any of the slicing kind of sword
skills?” I asked.
My partner’s voice was hard—surely due to her struggle to
control the cold and not because she was actually mad at me—as
she replied, “When I reached proficiency one hundred fifty a while
back, I learned to use one called Folium.”
“Yeah, I guess that would work. Okay, next time the wraith
approaches, use Folium right at the middle of its chest.”
“Wh…which part is the middle?” she yelled back. I didn’t have
any immediate answers. Against kobolds or reptoids, I’d tell her
“Where the heart is”; all humanoids, including players, had hearts
(critical points) located just to the left of the center of the chest.
Yet, the little nodule I felt in the wraith’s chest had been directly
in the middle. There was no other way to define it.
“Um…”
I put the sword behind my back and looked around, then
picked up a dusty dessert knife off the dining table. It had almost
no value as a weapon, and I didn’t have the Throwing Knives skill,
so it wasn’t going to do any real damage, but…
“Yah!”
I tossed the knife, concentrating only on Accuracy, and it
landed in the middle of the swaying wraith’s chest, right where
the little nodule would be, doing just a single pixel of damage to
its HP bar before falling to the floor. A red damage effect appeared
for just a few scant seconds on the tattered white dress.
“There!” I shouted, but Asuna was already on the move. The
wraith floated down from the ceiling as she approached.
Asuna had learned the Annoying Wraith’s “path of least
resistance” evasion methods from her previous experience and
91|P

kept the rapier at her side, luring the enemy in as close as
possible. The wraith’s arms, mostly bone, reached out to grab her
again, and a lime-green light burst into being.
The sword skill Folium was a rare slashing attack for the rapier
category, but its trajectory was an unorthodox one. It curved
upward from the left hip, then jutted into a sharp loop at its peak
and ended at the lower right, much like a lowercase cursive l. The
intention was to deflect the enemy’s attack before giving them a
counter, but it wasn’t suited for hitting a specific point.
Or so I thought.
“Teyaa!” The Chivalric Rapier entered the wraith’s right side to
perfectly pin the point I’d indicated—before doing a loop and
exiting out the left flank. It must’ve broken the tiny weak point,
because the third of its HP bar that remained drained all the way
to the left edge. The Annoying Wraith let out a hideous wail and
burst.
My partner straightened up without a word and returned her
sword to its sheath.
I strolled up to her. “Yo, nice control. Did your Accuracy boost
kick in just now? Or was that…?”
“Pah-choo!” she answered by way of sneezing. She let go of the
rapier and wrapped her body in her arms, her face pale. “I…I’m so
cold.”
“Yeah, you took a Chill effect…I think it wears off after five
minutes, so you’ve just gotta…”
“Pah-choo!”
Her second sneeze drowned out the words tough it out. Even
knowing it was essentially harmless, I couldn’t help but pity her
paleness and shivering.
At the very end of the beta, we started getting Purify Crystals
that could instantly undo multiple debuffs, including this one, but
here on the sixth floor, crystals were just starting to become
droppable and were still very rare. The only other way to undo
the effects would be the individual method for each one—
antidote potions for poison, undoing a curse at the church, etc.
Chill had its own special recovery method, of course. You could
warm up by the fire, but lanterns and torches didn’t put off
92|P

enough heat. On the other hand, there was that fireplace in the
previous room—it occurred to me that it had been put there by
design so you could undo the ghosts’ effects—but it would be a bit
of a pain in the ass. No, a major pain in the ass.
Instead, I opened my window to test out a convenient but
somewhat embarrassing method. With both hands, I removed a
thick blanket for camping and draped it over my back like a cape.
To cover up the embarrassment of what I was about to do, I
focused on thoughts like These long-haired cattle blankets sure are
heavy, and I could really use a down-filled bedroll by now, and I bet
that would be expensive. When I reached Asuna, who looked at me
in surprise, I said, “Pardon me” and drew her closer so I could
wrap us both up under the blanket.
Instantly, her body froze like a rod between my arms, and right
at my ear, her high-pitched, hoarse voice said, “Hey, wh-what are
you…doi…? Pah-choo!”
“This is the quickest way to undo the Chill effect. Just put up
with it for another twenty seconds.”
The icy chill from her body started seeping into me, making my
nose itch. The chill was just a virtual skin sensation created by the
NerveGear, and my real body would be in some hospital room
with perfectly controlled temperature at the moment, but I
couldn’t help but wonder if sneezing here was also prompting a
sneeze out there…
“L-listen, even if this is supposed to help undo the debuff, if
someone sees us like this, they’re going to get the wrong fwuh…”
Right at the moment that she trailed off with that odd sound,
the chill trickling from her body into mine suddenly vanished. I’d
experienced that before: When the Chill effect wore off, it left the
body feeling pleasantly warm. It was like the feeling of taking off
your clothes in a changing room in the winter, only to sink right
into a tub full of delightfully hot water. I couldn’t blame her for
letting out an odd moan.
She stared at nothing, mind out of focus, until she snapped
back to attention, eyes blinking rapidly, and ducked out of my
arms.

93|P

“Um, that wasn’t…It’s not…” she babbled, mouth working
furiously, and then spun away from me. “W-well…I’m grateful to
you for undoing the debuff. But next time, I’d appreciate an
explanation first!”
“I figured if I had to describe it first, it would be twice as
embarrassing,” I said, putting the heavy blanket back into storage.
To my surprise, Asuna said, “Why, that sounds like you’ve done
it before.”
“Huh?! W-well, I knew about it because I’d done it in the beta,
of course…but let me be very clear that the other person was like
Wolfgang from the Bro Squad but twice as hairy and supermacho, okay?”
“…I don’t know if I wish I could’ve seen that or not,” the fencer
said, a very strange and subtle smile on her lips. At least her mood
had improved. She walked around the dining room, examining the
table and the paintings on the wall, but found nothing.
“Well, that made our battle against the ghosts meaningless.”
“Hey, that’s just how quests go,” I bantered back, now that our
usual mood had returned. We left the dining room and returned
to the hallway.
Between the kitchen, the study, and the bedroom, we defeated
four more Annoying Wraiths but still had not found the key item.
At last, we were at the final door. Asuna grabbed the doorknob,
then side-eyed me.
“Kirito, you didn’t know ahead of time that we weren’t going to
find anything in the first five rooms, did you?”
“I…I don’t know how I could have. Like I said, the item would
pop in any of the six rooms at random in the beta. I’m…sure that’s
what happened just now, too.”
“You said that like an NPC,” Asuna accused, which was an odd
thing to say. She opened the door, and a musty smell stung my
nostrils.
I recalled that the last door led to a storeroom. I followed
Asuna inside, holding my lantern up. It was the smallest of the six
rooms, full of wooden shelves lined with wooden boxes, pots, and
various items of all sorts.
“Ugh…do we have to open up all these things to search?”
94|P

“I’d rather not do that, either,” I mumbled, passing through the
maze of standing shelves to the back of the room. At the very end,
there was a small writing desk along the wall, and sitting atop it,
seemingly abandoned in a very meaningful way, was an object
that dully reflected the glow of the lantern.
It was a large key, sitting under ten years of dust.
“Oh! That must be it!” Asuna exclaimed eagerly, trotting up to
the desk. I tried to grab her shoulder, but my hand closed on
nothing but empty air.
“Asuna, your feet!” I shouted, right as a cracking sound went off
under her foot. In the wavering light of the lantern, I saw an old,
faded bone.
Asuna froze in a very unnatural position, right as the boss
encounter ghost of this haunted house quest emerged from the
wall behind the desk.
Unlike the previous wraiths, this Resentful Wraith was male.
Once again, my English skill wasn’t quite up to the task of
informing me what the word resentful meant.
The tall, gaunt ghost wore a sweeping, tattered robe like the
ancient Romans did, brandishing its freakishly long nails and
opening its mouth wide enough that the jaw seemed dislocated so
that it could scream, “Byoouuu!!”
As I reached for the sword over my back, it occurred to me that
the situation wasn’t great.
The Resentful Wraith couldn’t take down our HP, of course, but
it had a wide variety of debuffs, and if we suffered all of them at
once, it would take quite some time to recover. That wasn’t the
worst thing in the world, but I was also afraid of losing the
progress we’d made against the wraiths in conquering Asuna’s
fear of ghosts. I wanted to keep its attention focused on me, but
with hardly four feet of space between the stone wall on the left
and wooden shelves on the right, there was barely room to swing
my sword, much less switch spots with Asuna.
“Asuna, regroup in the hallway!” I shouted, reaching out for her
shoulder again. But before I made contact, I heard her voice, much
firmer than I would have expected it to be:
“Kirito, can I break the bones on the floor?!”
95|P

“Oh…uh, I think those are just there to be spooky.”
“Got it!” she shouted, taking a stance that scattered the bones
below. She drew her rapier and thrust a series of five jabs with
tip-blurring speed at the approaching Resentful Wraith. They
were all aimed at the center of its chest, and while the first four
did not have much effect, the fifth one did take a good 15 percent
of its HP bar down. The elven blade had scratched the weak point,
which must’ve been in the same place as the earlier enemies’.

96|P

97|P

“Byaaaaa!!” the spirit shrieked with rage, rising up to the
ceiling. It began a bewitching technique utilizing a figure-eight
motion, but without the space of the dining room, its side-to-side
movement was limited. Relieved, I realized that this would make
it easier for the rapier to aim at the spots where it was floating,
letting us take down its HP much faster…
“I’m sick and tired of dealing with ghosts!”
But then Asuna jumped up onto the writing desk, nearly
kicking the crucial item away as she launched herself into the air.
At the top of her jump, she activated the sword skill Shooting Star.
The silver visual effect ran from the tip to the entire weapon—
even the body of its wielder—creating an invisible propulsive
force. With a twinkling sound effect, Asuna’s rapier shot toward
the ceiling and caught the ghost square in the chest, gouging a
huge hole in its transparent body.
Ah, I see, I thought, impressed. A charging rapier sword skill can
hit a pinpoint target with much wider coverage. The Resentful
Wraith issued a hideous, fractal scream and vanished…and the
Chivalric Rapier’s tip smashed into the ceiling, creating a purple
burst of light.
Midair activation of sword skills was a highly technical move
that, in essence, allowed you to double jump, but it also had its
downsides—if you jumped higher than you intended and suffered
fall damage, or if you hit an obstacle and took collision damage.
Since we were in town, there was no HP loss for hitting walls or
the ceiling, but it struck me as poor form to stand by and watch
my partner fall clumsily to the ground.
Therefore, I took two steps forward, estimating where the
rebound from hitting the wall of code would send Asuna, and held
out my arms. I wasn’t entirely confident in my strength stat or my
(nonexistent) Carrying skill proficiency, but I did succeed at
catching her in a bridal-style hold. When I looked down at her
face, I saw hazel-brown eyes blinking back at me.
I thought she was just a bit stunned by the impact, but that
didn’t seem to be the case. Her mouth opened and closed a few
times before she finally squeaked, “Thank you.”
“You’re welcome.”
98|P

I set her back on her feet. We both took a deep breath for some
reason. It had been an experience, but the haunted house
exploration quest was done for now.
“You beat the boss, so you should get the key, Asuna,” I urged.
The young woman started to approach the writing desk, but she
stopped to look down at the bones she’d scattered just moments
ago. She turned toward me.
“…Hey, these bones aren’t Pithagrus’s, are they?”
“Huh? Uh, no…they wouldn’t be. Remember, Cylon the disciple
killed Pithagrus to become the lord of Stachion and buried his
body in the yard behind the mansion.”
“Then who do these bones belong to?”
“Um…”
I had to think about this. Because I’d already spoiled the
ending, putting the order of the details and story twists together
was getting rather complicated.
“…Well, we skipped past that step, but remember how I told
you about the proper order of looking up the code to the frontdoor lock?” I asked.
“Oh, right…you’re supposed to go back to Stachion and then
look at the painting in the lord’s chamber?”
“That’s right. And you only know the painting is a hint when
Cylon tries to hide it…which would tell you that Cylon knows the
digits to that lock are hidden in the painting.”
“Oh, I see…But does that really make sense? If he knows the
number to unlock this house, why doesn’t Cylon come and
investigate this place himself? And then he’d find this key. It’s the
key to whatever place is hiding the golden cube, right?”
I was impressed at the speed of Asuna’s understanding and her
ability to extrapolate ahead of the information given.
“That’s a good point. So the reason he couldn’t do that must be
because Cylon knows the numbers but not where to use them.
Remember? The only person who knew this was Pithagrus’s
second house was the bartender he would visit—the last person
we talked to in Stachion. Pithagrus kept this place a secret from
everyone, including his apprentices and servants.”
“…But why?”
99|P

“You’ll know if you check the books in the study.”
“Ewww.” She grimaced.
In any fantasy RPG, books were a major presence among
interior decoration elements. A house should have a bookshelf,
and a bookshelf should have books, of course.
But books are one of a game designer’s worst enemies. Unlike
furniture or utensils, books are made important by their contents.
And filling the vast number of in-game books with meaningful
content is practically impossible. Therefore, most games either
make it impossible to remove the books from the shelf, or they
limit access to just a few books, with only a couple pages being
viewable.
But SAO, likely through some fixation of Akihiko Kayaba’s,
bravely challenged this limitation. All the books in this world
were fully functioning ones that could be taken from the shelf, and
all the pages contained print. Generating all that content from
scratch was apparently a bridge too far, as nearly all the books
simply contained the text of classic books in the public domain as
of 2024, in their original languages. So the vast majority of players
could look at the books, but reading them was too difficult. I’d
heard rumors that some Japanese books were floating around,
too, but I’d never seen one.
It was odd to think of books written in real-world languages
being on the shelves of a world that contained elves and dwarves
and such. But if you started down that road, you’d have to wonder
why the NPCs were speaking Japanese, too.
So this was why you could take a book and peruse its contents,
but the thought of checking them made even Asuna groan.
“…I feel like I’ve seen enough Cyrillic and Arabian script to last
me a lifetime,” she grumbled.
“Don’t feel bad. It’s all Greek to me…Sorry, sorry, just a joke,” I
added when I saw the look she was giving me. “Most of the books
in the study are what you’d expect, but a few mixed in are like
manuals for puzzles. In other words, Pithagrus the puzzle king
kept his secret books with the solutions to the previous lords’
puzzles and his own here in his secret home for safekeeping. It’s

100|P

just that if we tried to read them, we wouldn’t make any sense of
them.”
“Ah, I see…Well, I hate to speak ill of the dead, but he sounds
like a bit of a miser. Maybe if he’d allowed his apprentices to read
these, rather than hogging them all to himself, he wouldn’t have
wound up getting killed,” Asuna said, shaking her head sadly.
Then she looked at the bones on the floor. “So…whose bones are
these, then?”
“Cylon’s henchman. Like us, he heard about the second home
from the bar, and he got this far using the combination from Cylon
to open the lock…but before he could return to report to his
master, the wraiths got him.”
“Wait, you mean the person who died here wasn’t the wraith
we just fought…?”
“If so, then there should have been bones in the other rooms
where we found the Annoying Wraiths, right? It seems like once a
house is left unattended to fall into ruin, ghosts just naturally
swarm there.”
“…If I ever buy a player home here, I’m cleaning it every single
day. And you’re not allowed to leave it cluttered, either, Kirito.”
“Yeah, yeah…” I muttered, but then I stopped in my tracks.
Hmm? What sort of a situation is she envisioning in this scenario?
She looked confused by the way I was pondering this, then
reflected on what she’d just said, and her white skin instantly
turned red.
“No!!”
“O…kay?” I said, startled by her sudden outburst. She grabbed
my left shoulder.
“It’s not that! It’s definitely not that!!”
“O…kay.”
I wasn’t sure what “that” was, but the point-blank lasers
shooting from her eyes convinced me that I should indicate I
understood. Asuna snorted, let go of my shoulder, and spun
around to head to the desk. She snatched the key and returned in
a huff.
“This is the item, right?”

101|P

On the left side of my vision, the quest log updated, so I told
her, “Yep.”
“And what door does this open?”
“Dunno.”
“You don’t know…?”
“The only person who knows is the one who hid the golden
cube and left the key on this desk.”
“…So we have to find that person now…” she said, looking
briefly crestfallen. But she quickly recovered, opening her game
window and putting the key into her inventory. “Yikes, it’s after
nine already. We’ll have to continue tomorrow.”
“I agree. Or…I would, but…” I said, considering very carefully
how much I ought to spoil. “Well…something’s going to happen in
a bit that will surprise you, but it definitely won’t pose a danger to
our lives…In other words, there’s no HP loss. So react calmly.”
“H-huh? What do you mean…? What’s going to happen?”
“Look, I wouldn’t want to ruin the best part of a movie for you,
would I? Just think of it as a roller coaster and enjoy the ride.”
“That does not make me anticipate a good time…” Asuna
grumbled, looking around. There was no difference in the walls
and shelves surrounding us. Eventually, she summoned her
courage, closed her window, then grabbed my shoulders and spun
me around.
“You go first, Kirito.”
“Got it.”
I knew that the order we walked in wasn’t going to matter for
what happened next, so I stifled my mad grin and started walking
back the way we’d come. We passed through the maze of shelves
and reached the doorway. Now back in the darkened hallway, I
glanced over my shoulder at Asuna’s nervous expression, then
proceeded toward the distant front door.
On the left, we passed the doors of all the rooms we’d already
searched. Soon, the light from the lantern in my left hand reached
the entrance hall. It was practically a room of its own, so the light
didn’t catch every last corner from the hallway. Even knowing
that we were safe, and that this was the second time passing

102|P

through this location, I couldn’t help but feel my nerves activating
as I stepped into the entryway.
Suddenly, there was a pshooo! sound, and a cloud of venomous
green smoke ascended to block my vision.
Normally, you’d stand a chance at avoiding a poison mist trap
like this if you caught your breath in time, but since this was a
forced event, that didn’t matter. Behind me, Asuna screamed, and
I reached out to grab her hand and keep her calm. The smoke
soon reached the level of our faces. The moment I sensed the
acrid scent, I felt my legs go numb, and we toppled to the floor.
In the upper left corner, our HP bars were surrounded by
borders the color of the smoke. It indicated a paralysis state…but
while under normal paralysis you could still use your right arm
(barely), now we were completely unable to move—or even
speak. Fortunately, the sense of touch was still intact, so through
our skin contact, I willed Asuna not to worry.
In thirty seconds, the gas was completely gone without a trace,
and the source of it became visible in the light of the lantern,
which now lay on the floor. It was a small pot, with a helpful skull
symbol on the side. Then there were two sets of approaching
footsteps.
In the corner of the entrance hall appeared two men in
matching hooded cloaks, large and small—only identifiable as
men because I already knew who they were. Beneath their deep
hoods, they wore odd leather masks that covered their entire
faces.
The large man stopped in the middle of the floor, but the
smaller one approached us, then picked up the pot. He put it away
in his cloak, then pulled back the hood and removed the mask,
which clearly kept him safe from the gas.
“…!!”
I heard Asuna’s gasp.
Visible in the orange lantern light were the sunken cheeks,
balding head, and impressive beard of the lord of Stachion, Cylon.
“Well, well…I’m quite surprised, swordsman. I did not think
you’d find Pithagrus’s hideaway so soon. It took me many years to

103|P

find it…because I never expected it would be in Suribus, rather
than Stachion.”
He shook his head theatrically, then glanced past me down the
hallway. “I am curious about the hidden formula behind his
puzzles that he kept so secret…but I’ll start with this first.”
He walked past me, his oddly upturned shoes clacking against
the floor, and reached for Asuna. Through some kind of sleight of
hand—or probably just to make the story scene work—the
golden key appeared in his palm, when it should have been safe in
her inventory. He examined its fine details and exhaled heavily.
“Ahhh…I’d been hoping I would find the cube itself here…but I
do have an idea of where I might find the door for this key. Surely,
the item I seek will be there,” he said, his dejection morphing into
a pleasant smile. He tucked the key away into his cloak and
stroked his long beard.
“You did very good work for me, swordsman. Normally, this is
where I would say farewell…but in fact, I have another job for you
to do. Do you mind if I ask for your cooperation once more…?”
He extended his left hand and snapped his fingers. The large
masked man, who hadn’t said a word, walked over and pulled a
large sack from his cloak. He knelt down and grabbed my collar
with an abnormally thick fist, easily lifted me up, and tossed me
into the sack. I’d experienced this before, but in the beta, I beat
the quest on my own. When in a group of two, would they bring
out two sacks, or just…?
My question was answered when the mouth of the sack
opened again, and my partner landed on top of me. I would’ve
grunted with the impact, if I was able to use my voice yet. Surely,
Asuna would not be happy about this, but she’d have to deal with
it for the sake of our quest XP.
Over her shoulder, I saw the large man peering into the bag.
Then he closed the opening, and we could see nothing.
I could feel the big man hefting us up and over his back. Our
sack swayed in rhythm with each plodding footstep. There was
the sound of a door opening and closing. Through the heavy
burlap, I heard the faint sound of the river and the distant music
from NPC musicians.
104|P

At this hour, many players would still be eating and shopping
in Suribus. And we were being abducted and carried right through
all of that—a rather daring setup for a quest. The sack was big
enough with the two of us in it; what would happen if it was a full
six-man party…? Before I could imagine the possibilities, there
was a heavy thump, and we stopped swaying. I could hear sounds
of exhaust close by—a horse breathing—and then we were
loaded onto a carriage bed.
In moments, the carriage rocked again, probably as the large
man and Cylon got into the box seat. There was the sound of a
whip cracking, then clopping hooves and rattling wheels. The
carriage was slowly making its way down the riverside path.
The paralysis still prevented me from moving or speaking, but
knowing that we were getting a free taxi back to Stachion made
the experience bearable. The bigger problem was that I had no
idea how Asuna—who was resting on top of me—felt about all
this. Once we were free to move again, she’d probably scream at
me to warn her what was going to happen first, but for now I
wanted to believe that she’d understand I was just trying to save
the surprise and fun of this climactic scene for her to enjoy.
Within minutes, the carriage was out of town, and the road
beneath the wheels turned from paving stone to dirt. It was a mile
to Stachion, with no monsters along the way, meaning the trip
would be just five minutes long. Naturally, the event would
continue after reaching the town, so it would probably be another
thirty minutes or so until we fully regained our freedom. At this
rate, we’d be spending the night in Stachion, rather than Suribus…
“Bree-hee-hee!!”
The carriage came to a violent stop as the horse whinnied. I
opened my eyes wide, which was about the only thing I could
control, but there was no way to see what was happening outside
the sack.
“Who goes there?! I am Cylon, lord of Stachion!” he shouted. It
was followed by the sound of metal striking metal.
The horse whinnied again, and the cart tipped over. I would
have shouted if I could. The sack tumbled away with us inside it
and landed on a short patch of grass. The impact knocked the
105|P

mouth of the sack slightly open, giving us a better view of the
outside.
On top of the carriage, Cylon and a bandit in a black hood were
fighting with swords, and a short distance away, the large man in
the leather mask was in combat with a similar bandit. Cylon and
his assistant’s cursors were yellow, while the bandits’ were
orange.
This event had not happened in the beta. It wasn’t that unusual
for the quests in the full release to be different, but it did mean
that my prior knowledge wasn’t going to help anymore. We’d still
have to wait for the paralysis to wear off, but once it did, we might
be asked to choose between siding with Cylon or the bandits—or
just to run away…
“…!!”
I thought I felt Asuna tense and breathe harder than usual.
A moment later, I understood why.
We’d fought a number of forest elves who were treated like
NPCs. Their color cursors were red, just like monsters. But the
black-hooded bandits fighting Cylon had orange cursors. The
color of criminals.
They weren’t NPCs. They were players.
Just as this dawned on me, the bandit fighting in the bed of the
carriage used a sword skill and mercilessly cut down Cylon. The
force of the momentum pulled the attacker’s hood back, exposing
his face.
Glinting in the pale moonlight was a silver chain coif with the
ends tattered and hanging—and a large, leering grin underneath.
I knew that face. He had a sword now, but I would never
mistake him for anyone else. It was the axman who challenged me
to a duel on the third floor with the intent of killing me…
It was Morte.
Cylon’s paralyzing poison only immobilized the body and had
no effect on the mind of the player—but I couldn’t think for
several moments.
At last, a question floated into my head—and then the answer.
They were as fleeting as bubbles rising and popping.

106|P

What in the world are Morte and his friend doing?
…That should be obvious. They’re not saving me and Asuna from
Cylon. Just the opposite: They’re taking advantage of our paralysis
to kill us.
Then how did they know that we would be paralyzed and
passing through this spot at this exact time?
…Did they trail us the whole way? No. Morte was a beta tester
like me. He would probably know all about the “Curse of Stachion”
quest, and he would know that if he staked out Pithagrus’s hideout,
he would see me and Asuna show up eventually.
So how do we escape?
………
But no amount of waiting brought the answer to the third
question to my mind.
It was perfectly possible to interfere with another player’s
quest if it was happening out in the open, and I’d experienced that
in other games before SAO. But it never even occurred to me that
something like this could have happened.
Cylon was slumped on the floor of the carriage bed, his nowempty sword hand thrust up toward his attacker. “Killing a lord is
a grave and terrible crime!” he shouted. “You will never be
allowed in Stachion—or through the gates of any other town
again!”
I couldn’t tell if this line was part of one of Cylon’s dialogue
patterns or something spontaneous that he came up with when
faced with unexpected death. In either case, his threat had no
effect on Morte. The axman took two steps forward, still grinning,
transferred to a one-handed ax with the Quick Change ability, and
brought it down on Cylon’s head.
The HP bar underneath the cursor name CYLON went to zero,
and the lord of Stachion slowly rocked backward, right hand still
outstretched, and tumbled from the cart. His body bounced right
near our feet on the ground and came to an unnatural stillness
before shattering into a swarm of tiny blue shards.
107|P

Like you might expect from a lord, he dropped a number of
items among the hoards of gold and silver coins, causing them to
jangle and clatter on the ground. It was the kind of profit you’d
turn into an orange player to make, but Morte paid it no mind. He
gazed down at us from the carriage. His eyes were hidden under
the edge of the coif, but the smile on his thin lips grew wider.
Just then, the other hooded bandit fighting the larger man on
the other side of the carriage screeched, “Hey, if you’re done with
the old man, help me out! This fat-ass is pretty high-level!”
I craned my eyes as far as they could go and saw the large man,
his huge fists wrapped in leather straps studded with metal,
swinging at the smaller hooded player nimbly darting around.
The bandit had a thin dagger in his hand, which told me he must
be the one who was meeting with Morte in the underground
catacombs on the fifth floor. If these two were around, then it was
possible that the boss of the PK gang was nearby—the man in the
black poncho who tried to kill me during the fireworks show—
but I didn’t sense him yet.
The dagger user darted around the large man’s punches and
struck back deftly, but he maintained his distance and wasn’t
getting close enough to do big damage. At this point, our only
hope was to rely on the man who had stuck us in this sack in the
first place. If he could hold out for a few minutes, even with Morte
involved, Asuna and I might recover from our paralysis.
But…
“Sorry, I’m busy right now. If you can’t take him out, then pull
him into the forest and lose him there, please,” Morte
commanded, then turned back to us. His partner protested, but it
seemed clear that Morte held a higher position in their gang.
Instead, he yelled at the large man to follow him and raced into
the thick woods on the south side of the road. The man in the
leather mask issued a muffled roar and pounded after him.
When the two pairs of footsteps had vanished, there was a
deafening silence left behind. For some reason, the usual calls of
the night insects and owls hooting were completely gone.
Into that silence landed the sound of light feet. Morte had
jumped from the bed of the carriage. The ax he’d used to kill Cylon
108|P

rested on his shoulder, and he stepped carelessly over the
scattered coins on the ground as he approached me and Asuna
where we lay.
“…Well, well, well. I’ve been awaiting you, Kirito. I had a feeling
you’d accept the lord’s quest, but I wasn’t so positive that I was
gonna follow you the whole way from the start. Instead, I just sat
watching Py-whatsit’s hideout from an inn starting last night…Oh!
Whoopsie.”
His leer turned a bit embarrassed, and he scratched the side of
his head with the back of the ax.
“Boss always tells me I oughta watch out about talkin’ too
much, but it doesn’t look like that’s ever going to change, does it?
On the other hand, it’d really suck if you recovered from your
paralysis while I’m just chatting on and on, so I’m afraid this is
where we say good-bye.”
He spun the ax in his fingers, twirling it audibly, then gripped it
straight and began to walk again.
Just at that moment, the green border around my and Asuna’s
HP bars began to blink. Thirty seconds until the debuff wore off
naturally…but five seconds was all he’d need to kill a defenseless
player.
Asuna was sprawled on her side with her back to me, so I
couldn’t see her face. I couldn’t say a word to her or hold her
hand.
I let this situation come about due to my own lack of caution. I
knew we’d be carried out of town in a totally helpless state, and I
should have realized that this would leave us vulnerable to
possible PKers. And even if I hadn’t figured it out, perhaps Asuna
would have been observant enough to spot my folly, if I hadn’t
been so preoccupied with my precious story surprises.
I had to find a way to get Asuna out of this death trap, even if it
required sacrificing myself.
The boots crunched closer.
The debuff wasn’t gone yet.
My heart jackhammered.
This wasn’t a virtual signal. I knew that wherever I was in the
real world, my heart was racing there, too. My mind was
109|P

compressed, time passing slower than it should, as my brain sped
through all possible choices.
I could see Asuna’s chestnut-brown hair, the green grass, and
the navy forest in the background…as well as the assortment of
items Cylon dropped upon his death. Gold coins, silver,
mysterious pouches, a rather expensive-looking longsword, his
leather mask, an iron key, a golden key, a small jar, and those
shoes with the upturned toes.
A possibility shot through my mind, as instantaneous as
lightning.
I couldn’t move my arms or legs at the moment. But there were
two things I could do.
One was look. The other was breathe.
Morte came to a stop just a foot and a half behind me; I was
lying on my side. While I couldn’t see him directly, his shadow
was black on the ground, silently raising the ax high over his head.
At that moment, I expelled the lungful of air I was holding
through pursed lips.
I was aiming for the small jar, which was standing upright
about three feet away. It had a skull mark on the side—it was
what Cylon had used to paralyze us. It must have reinitialized in
its default state when it dropped, because it was stopped up
closed rather than open and empty.
The jar was only two inches tall, and exhaled breath here
tended to be exaggerated—we’d been able to blow up the innertube fruits on the fourth floor with a single breath—but I wasn’t
sure if I’d be able to knock it over. To my surprise, however,
another gust of air descended upon it at the same time. Asuna had
come to the same conclusion and attempted the same trick.
The little jar lurched sideways with the force of two breaths at
once. It tilted back, lurched forward—and toppled. The lid, which
was simply resting in place, rolled off onto the ground, and that
vicious green smoke shot out with startling force. I sucked in a
huge, deep breath of clean air and held it.
Instantly, the smoke enveloped us, turning everything green. I
heard the clicking of a tongue and sensed Morte scurrying away.

110|P

The blinking of the green border around my HP gauge grew
quicker and quicker.
In Aincrad, raising two different kinds of stats could allow you
to exhibit physical strength and speed that were impossible in
real life. But there were a few scant things in a full-dive VRMMO
that were still derived from your actual physical body.
One of those things was lung capacity. If water covered your
head, the game registered you in the Drowning state, but as long
as you held your breath, there would be no HP loss. Since that
breath was not only the avatar’s, but your physical body’s, that
meant that players who had higher lung capacity in the real world
could move around longer underwater. The same property
applied to holding your breath against poison gas.
I didn’t get much exercise in elementary or middle school, so
my confidence in my lung capacity was low, but Cylon’s gas had
only lasted for thirty seconds at the haunted house, and I knew I
could at least hold it that long. The problem was whether the
paralysis still had that much time left…and if Morte would stay
clear for the full thirty seconds.
It had been five…six…seven seconds since the gas started—and
the HP bar border and debuff icon were gone. Instantly, feeling
returned to my body, and I pushed myself up with my left hand,
reaching for my sword with my right.
That was when Morte came charging through the curtain of
poison toward me.
The gas was so thick that I could only see a vague outline of the
enemy’s shape. The same was true for Morte, but the blow he
hurled, cutting through the smoke, was perfectly aimed at my
face.
If I blocked the head of the ax swooping toward me with my
sword alone, I would lose in terms of weight and momentum. But
I also didn’t have time to slash at it from a crouched position. I
had no choice but to put my left hand up behind the blade and
assume a two-handed blocking pose.
Morte’s ax smashed against the side of the Sword of Eventide,
spraying sparks that were nearly blinding, even in the thick haze.
The impact was so strong that I was briefly afraid my sword
111|P

would break, but the Yofilis clan’s legendary blade absorbed it
valiantly—the rebound buckling Morte’s stance slightly.
“……!!”
I bolted up with a dull roar, executing the basic martial arts
skill Flash Blow with my left hand. My fist shot forward wreathed
in red light, which Morte blocked with his clenched right arm—
but not solidly enough to keep himself from tipping off-balance. I
had a post-skill pause, too, but of all the sword skills I knew, Flash
Blow had the shortest delay. When I recovered less than a second
later, Morte was still reeling.
His right side was guarded by his tough-looking ax, but his left
was defenseless. The best way to strike him there would be with
the longsword skill Horizontal—
No. Wait.
When I fought Morte at the forest elf camp on the third floor,
he used Quick Change to switch his sword for his ax. But he also
brought up a round shield alongside the ax. But now his left hand
was empty. Did he change his style? Why—?
To make me think his left hand was empty.
“!!”
I gritted my teeth and stopped myself from using the sword
skill I was just about to cue up, pulling back my blade. At the same
moment, Morte snapped his left wrist and threw something at my
face.
The object split the poison gas and deflected off my sword,
which I barely lifted in time. Based on the loud metallic clang and
the strength of impact, I could guess that it was a throwing pick—
probably poisoned.
In the time that I drew my sword back to defend, Morte had
recovered, but he chose to withdraw rather than counterattack.
He jumped backward, and I followed, careful for any additional
throwing darts. In five seconds, I was out of the poison gas, so I
expelled my breath and sucked in fresh air.
Five yards up ahead, Morte took a breath of his own, his mouth
wide with glee.
“Ha-ha…Well done, Kirito. I can’t believe you blocked that.”

112|P

“Say, wherever did you get that very dangerous and rare
poisoned pick?” I asked him, glancing at the polished Sword of
Eventide to see what was reflected in its surface from behind me.
Asuna recovered at the same time I did, but she hadn’t left the
green smoke yet. The debuff icon was gone from her HP bar, so I
knew she hadn’t sucked in a new dose of it, but I didn’t know
what reason she might have for not moving yet.
“Well, if I told you that, you’d go and get it yourself, wouldn’t
you? It’s surprising how useful these things can be,” Morte leered,
reaching down to draw a fresh one from his belt.
Poison in SAO—especially the paralyzing kind—was incredibly
dangerous, as evidenced by the way he’d nearly used that
paralysis event to kill us. For that reason, it was very, very hard
for players to make use of it. Not only was it difficult enough to
craft a high-level paralysis agent with the Mixing skill, spreading
it on your weapon alone did not have any effect. The weapon itself
needed to have an extremely rare Toxicity attribute, and I’d never
even seen a weapon like that, much less found one. The man in
the black poncho, Morte’s boss, had claimed the knife he had on
my back was augmented with level-5 paralysis and level-5 poison,
but I later discovered that was just a bluff.
But the four-inch pick Morte had between his fingers was
shining with oily residue under the light of the moon. He’d clearly
given up on his shield and accepted the “irregular equipment”
status that made him ineligible to use sword skills, all just so he
could perform sneak attacks with this thing, so it had to be a
poisoned weapon. Whatever solution he’d put on it, I was not
going to let him hit me.
Fortunately, picks were disposable weapons by nature, with
both buyable and droppable versions coming in sets of three. The
first one Morte threw went into the forest somewhere, so he had
two left. If I could remove them from the equation, I had the
advantage.
Morte’s leer softened a bit. He pushed his ax forward and hid
his throwing hand behind it. I set my sword up at mid-level, ready
to deflect from any angle.

113|P

The poison gas behind me was still there. It only lasted thirty
seconds when Cylon had gassed us, so I assumed it would be the
same here—but what if the activation period was compressed
just for the event, and once it had dropped for a player, its default
length was longer? If it was two minutes, or even just one, I
couldn’t guarantee that Asuna’s breath would hold out. If the
paralysis was gone, why wasn’t she emerging from the smoke…?
Right as I started to get legitimately worried, I heard a screech
from the far side of the smoke cloud.
“Whew! Finally lost him! Hey, you all done over there yet?”
The second hooded man who’d pulled the NPC into the woods
returned sooner than I expected. I gnashed my teeth, while
Morte’s smile returned. If Asuna was in some kind of trouble and
couldn’t get free, I’d have to fight one-on-two while protecting
her. In fact, her life was the top priority, so if need be, I’d have to
sacrifice myself so that my partner could escape.
In the flat of my blade, my impromptu rearview mirror, I saw a
dark hooded figure skirt the poison cloud at a wide distance.
“…Damn, he’s still alive? What’s up with this smoke anyway?
We weren’t supposed to be usin’ this, right?”
“It’s not mine. Kirito here found a way to utilize the NPC’s
poison item. Aha-ha-ha,” Morte replied.
The second hood clicked his tongue theatrically. “What a pain
in the ass. On the other hand…maybe I’m lucky, now that I get to
finish someone off? I still haven’t gotten over my rage at having
my Cilvaric Rapier stolen from me on the fifth floor. Hey, where’s
the woman?”
“She still seems to be paralyzed inside the smoke cloud.”
“Cool. Then let’s kill the beater over there first.”
Hood Number Two pulled a dark, gleaming dagger from his
waist.
I maintained my silence while the other two talked on either
side of me, but the instant Number Two mentioned Asuna, I felt
my blood boil and nearly leaped to the attack. But I knew that the
instant I turned my back to Morte, he’d throw the pick. The Coat
of Midnight I’d powered up at the dark elf camp was still powerful
enough to hang here on the sixth floor, despite it being the Last
114|P

Attack bonus prize for beating the boss on the very first floor. The
problem was that it was weak to piercing attacks, like all
nonmetal armor. It was only a minor deal in Aincrad, where there
were no bows and arrows, but alongside polearms like spears and
lances—and one-handed weapons like estocs and stilettos—
throwing picks were a perfectly serviceable kind of piercing
weapon.
I’d rush Morte as fast as I could to neutralize them, then defeat
his comrade. That was the only way out of this—but could I
actually overpower the axman, knowing that his dueling ability
was probably sharper since the last time we fought? Even if I had
the technique and statistics, could I myself cross that final line…?
Unlike in the real world, as long as you had a single pixel of
health left on your gauge, you could move and fight. So the only
way to guarantee his neutralization without poison or traps was
to reduce his HP to zero—to kill him.
Because Morte and the dagger user had attacked Cylon and his
assistant, their player cursors were orange, the color of criminals.
As a green player, I could attack them without penalty or fear of
turning orange myself, but that was only going by the rules of the
system. At the present moment, SAO was an inescapable death
game, and losing your HP meant the NerveGear would fry your
brain with intense microwaves. If I killed Morte and his friend, I
would be killing their biological bodies, wherever they were in
the real world.
Player-killing was actual murder now. Could I do that?
Demonic intuition saw right through me in that moment of
indecision.
“Shah!”
Morte hissed into movement. I jumped to my left to get out of
the way and to keep the dagger user in sight. But Morte read that
all the way and turned the same direction with me, swiping
sideways with his ax.
As long as he was holding the poison needle in his left hand,
he’d be registered as dual-wielding—and unable to use sword
skills. But Morte’s one-handed ax had a power that couldn’t be
overlooked, even using just ordinary attacks. Unlike the Anneal
115|P

Blade and its excellent weight and toughness, the Sword of
Eventide was sharp but light, and it might not stand up to tough
attacks if my guarding technique wasn’t thorough.
When I landed, I swayed backward, and the thick blade of the
ax roared directly where my neck had been. The swing was so
heavy that Morte ended up exposing his back to me. Despite my
stance, I could’ve attacked him from that position, but Hood
Number Two was bearing down on me with his dagger. If they
trapped me front and back in the open, I’d get hit by that poison
pick eventually. I needed to lure them to the woods on the north
side of the road so that I could fight with my back against a tree.
I bent my knees, ready to jump again.
Just then, the green cloud of smoke behind Number Two split
down the middle.
It was a fencer, dark red hooded cape flapping behind her,
silver rapier in her hand. Her face was hidden behind a monstrous
leather mask—the gas mask Cylon used in Pithagrus’s hideaway
and dropped upon his death. Asuna had been lurking in the midst
of the gas for over a minute because she’d been wearing it.
Both Morte, who was trying to pull his ax momentum back
toward me, and the onrushing Hood Number Two, failed to notice
her. She could take the advantage by using a sword skill against
the second one’s defenseless back.
But the question was: Could Asuna, who’d never experienced a
duel as a form of truly mortal combat, actually do this? If she
hesitated for even an instant during activation, the skill would
fumble, and she’d be frozen in place, open to a devastating
counter.
All through this moment of breath-stopping apprehension, I
kept my focus on Morte’s ax. If my expression caused Number
Two to realize the back attack, Asuna’s patience and trickery
would be lost. I had to believe in my partner.
“Shhu!”
Morte swung the ax again. I stepped backward only as little as I
needed to avoid it, keeping my eyes on his left hand. He was
looking for me to block the ax, giving him an opening to throw his

116|P

pick, so I had to keep out of the way with swaying and
quickstepping.
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Asuna racing at incredible
speed to close the gap, pulling back her rapier to strike. Her target
was rapidly slowing, perhaps noticing the footsteps behind him.
The fierce point of her weapon shone a brilliant red. Asuna’s
right arm and sword melted into the flow of light. As I prepared
for Morte’s third strike, I sent a silent message to my partner.
Go, Asuna!!
There was a series of heavy impacts. Her sword skill
Triangular hit the man right in the back, knocking off over a third
of his health.
“Aaah…crap!” he grunted in pain and fury, doing a roll and a
half over the ground with his back bleeding a huge damage visual
effect, but he did bounce up onto his feet rather than enter a fallen
state.
“She ain’t paralyzed! That was a dirty trick!” he yelled.
Asuna recovered from her post-skill delay and, ignoring his
hypocritical protest, pulled off her leather mask and tossed it to
the grass. In the pale moonlight, her beautiful features were fierce
with an anger—the likes of which I’d never seen. It was enough to
shut up the screeching man, that was for sure.
“Leave this one to me. You get Morte, Kirito.”
Her quiet voice arrived loud and clear at a distance of over
thirty feet. I gave her cold, glowing eyes the briefest of nods, then
turned to the axman.
The cruel mouth visible beneath his coif did not contain the
slightest hint of a smile any longer. “Oh, my,” he growled. “Our fun
has turned into a real predicament, very quickly.”
“You thought you were going to have an easy time killing some
immobilized people? Think again.”
“Now, now, it’s not settled yet. I still have two poison…picks!”
he shouted, flipping the ax in his right hand up vertically. I leaned
back on instinct as the darkened blade rushed toward my nose.
It hurt not to be able to guard, but Morte’s Harsh Hatchet was
upgraded with +6 to Heaviness, which was enough to weigh down

117|P

the avatar’s center of gravity at the start of the swing. It was a
very minor tell, but if you were watching for it, you could notice.
While Morte and I were locked in combat, Asuna and Hood
Number Two were going at it with quite spectacular results.
Both were speed types—the dagger and rapier flashing with
dizzying speed, lighting up the night with a shower of sparks. In
terms of pure speed, none of the frontline players could surpass
Asuna—if anyone could do it, Argo’s extreme AGI build might do
the trick. But in a player-on-player fight with no rules, her style
was just a little too straightforward. Against an opponent well
versed in feints and tricks, she was likely to meet stiff
competition.
But after she’d fallen onto her seat in simple practice bouts
against me, the fact that she was putting her all into a fight against
a true PKer was a sign of huge progress. I had to match her
example. I couldn’t stay on the defensive this whole time.
Morte continued swinging furiously at me, trying to force me
to block his ax—or just knock me off-balance so he could stab me
with the needle directly. In the real world, he would be out of
breath by now, but as long as you didn’t perform actions beyond
your strength variable, the hidden “fatigue quotient” would not be
a problem here.
The forest at night offered poor visibility and uneven footing,
so if I kept dodging, I was bound to trip over a root or stone
eventually. I had to break out of this situation before that
happened.
“Sh…shwaa!”
I evaded Morte’s consecutive swipes, sideways then vertical,
with quick, narrow footwork. Then I gambled: I pretended to trip
on something, slumping forward.
Morte pounced. “Haaaa!” he hissed, swinging the Harsh
Hatchet from above. He was stepping in quite far, since I’d been
pulling back with all of my evasion.
Axes were powerful whether equipped in one hand or two, but
if you got close enough—and you used all your boldness and
bravery—you could take advantage of their structural weakness.

118|P

“Argh!” I shouted, tensing my bent, “tripping” left leg and
launching myself forward off it. That pushed me inside of the
falling ax head’s path, where I could reach up with my left forearm
and brace it against the ax handle.
A fierce shock ran through my arm and shoulder, and I lost
about 5 percent of my HP. But at the same time, I activated the
sword skill Slant with my other hand. The glowing blue blade
struck Morte’s left arm as he was pulling his wrist back to flick the
poisoned projectile.
I figured that if I could get him to drop the pick, great. But my
dark elf masterpiece showed even greater ability in answering my
risky gamble. The sword silently sliced Morte’s arm off below the
elbow. His forearm burst into tiny crystal pieces, and the pick he
was holding fell to the grass.
I’d caused part-loss damage. He couldn’t throw his picks with
his left hand for at least three minutes, when he would recover
from this effect.
“Ha-ha!” Morte chuckled, either as a bluff or a sign that he still
had tricks up his sleeve. He jumped backward, vivid red particles
spilling from his severed arm like blood.
I wasn’t the type to pursue further attacks in a duel after I’d
already struck home. Throwing together sword skills in pursuit of
maximum damage also maximized your own vulnerability, and it
was very easy to suffer devastating consequences when caught up
in the moment.
But in this one instance, as soon as my skill delay was over, I
rushed forward, chasing after Morte as he withdrew. It seemed I
was angrier than I realized at the PKers for going after
Asuna…and at myself, for not recognizing the danger of the
paralysis event.
“Raaahh!!” I bellowed from deep in my gut, thrusting the sword
with a twist of my wrists. Multiple traces of pale blue light shot
from its tip, and an invisible force pushed me from behind. It was
the low thrusting skill, Rage Spike.
This sword skill, which unlocked at a one-handed sword’s
proficiency of 50, was one of the basic skills after Slant, Vertical,
and Horizontal. So it had low power, but unlike Sonic Leap, which
119|P

involved jumping high and striking downward, it thrust in a
straight line along the ground, making it more accurate and
harder to defend against.
With his left hand gone and no longer wielding weapons in
both hands, Morte was now free to use sword skills with his ax,
but seeing me bent over and racing along the ground, he instantly
abandoned the idea of countering. He flipped the ax over and held
it before him to guard.
The ax’s handle was essentially just a round stick, though some
could have spikes or little blades of their own. But because of that
structure, it was the weapon’s weak point during attack—though
unlike swords, an ax’s shaft was much less likely to be destroyed
when defending, no matter how it was struck. And with Morte’s
skill, he wouldn’t have too much trouble guarding my thrust with
the handle, even one less than an inch thick.
However, a thrust when blocked could still knock back the
target. Now was the time to put everything into this strike
without fear of reprisal—to let him know what he was dealing
with.
“Yaaa!” I bellowed, unleashing my sword straight for his chest.
“Sshheh!” Morte hissed, brandishing the ax handle in the path
of the pale blue line. The tip of my sword rushed forward, ready
to split that steel pole.
And then.
As though the sword moved on its own, the tip swayed just a
tiny bit to the right. The perfectly hard, implacable Sword of
Eventide, in this single moment, took on a living suppleness,
twisting itself to evade its obstacle…or so it seemed to me.
It grazed the edge of the Harsh Hatchet just enough to create
sparks, then regained its usual hardness, striking an inch to the
right of Morte’s center—directly into his heart, a critical point—
with terrifying accuracy.
The axman’s slim-fitting, dark gray scale armor was wetly
semi-reflective, suggesting that it was made not of metal, but
some monster-hide material. It looked easy to move in and quiet,
ideal for PKing, but its ability to deflect piercing and thrusting
attacks was no different from my long coat’s.
120|P

121|P

So the Sword of Eventide, rather than stopping as it would
against some thick metal plate, sliced through the gaps between
scales and sank deeper and deeper…
Kadaaamm!! I’d used this skill more times than I could count,
and even I’d never heard it produce that kind of blast. It vibrated
through my palm hard enough to shake my very skull. The
lighting effect the impact produced was two or three times
brighter than usual, making my vision go hazy and blue.
Sound, light, feedback. This was a true critical hit. And a weakpoint crit, too.
When the flash subsided, over half my sword was embedded in
Morte’s chest.
The HP bar in the middle of the orange cursor floating over the
axman’s head began to dwindle. It seemed to move slower than
usual, perhaps because I was in a state of heightened alert, but it
showed no signs of stopping. From a nearly full position, it
dropped to 70, then 60, then 50 percent and lower, into the
yellow warning zone.
I was certain it would stop soon, but the yellow line continued
narrowing at the same steady pace. It was down to 40 percent,
then 35…and 30. Now into the red warning zone, the bar headed
ever closer to the left end of the gauge.
When he’d challenged me to the half-finish duel on the third
floor, Morte softened me down to just over half my HP so he could
destroy the remainder in one final blow—a duel PK. But
ultimately, that fight ended with both HP bars at just over 50
percent.
25…23…it kept going. Was it possible to completely eradicate
all of a high-level player’s HP in a single blow, even with a true crit
against a weak point? Glowing red light spilled from where the
elven sword stuck into Morte’s chest, pulsing like blood. Through
the palm of my right hand, I felt a trembling like a heartbeat.
Neither I nor Morte budged an inch.
A number of times in the past, I’d suffered so much damage at
once that I couldn’t even breathe, much less move, while my HP
bar dropped. That was hard enough in the beta, but now the
consequences of death were permanent. If it didn’t stop, then
122|P

Morte…the guy lying on some bed somewhere in Japan…would be
put to death by his NerveGear.
Without realizing it, I glanced from his red HP bar to the face
under his chain coif. The red light pouring from his heart cast a
faint glow on the upper half of his face, which was consistently
sunken in shadow otherwise.
My first glance at the PKer showed me an ordinary young man,
maybe a few years older than me but still a teenager. His gaping
eyes stared at the space over my right shoulder…at the HP bar of
mine that only he could see. He wore no true expression, but his
lips, which were normally curled into a sneer, now parted slightly,
as if mouthing disbelief.
My mouth was open, too, and I wanted to ask him, even if just
through the movement of my lips, why he would ever choose to
PK in a world like this one…
…when a voice in an extremely grating, high-pitched register
pierced my eardrums from behind.
“Mamoru! Pull the sword ouuuut!!”
In an instant, I finally understood.
Morte’s HP hadn’t dropped this far just from the combined
critical hit. He was suffering continuous piercing damage. With
my sword still stuck in him, his HP continued to bleed out of him.
When he realized this, too, Morte let out an uncharacteristic,
panicked wail. He dropped the Harsh Hatchet and grabbed the
Sword of Eventide’s blade with his right hand.
If I clutched the handle of the sword with both hands and
pushed it toward the hilt, I could kill him in less than five seconds.
And I probably ought to. He tried to use the paralysis event to
kill Asuna and me. If he survived this, he would probably try
something similar again. I didn’t want to die, and I especially
didn’t want Asuna to die. She was going to grow into a far greater
warrior than me, lead the game’s population to victory, and save
thousands of lives.
Nothing was more important than Asuna’s life.
So it was utterly crucial that I took this step now, to
“Aaaah! Aaaaaaah!!”

123|P

There was a scream behind me—a sound not even human.
Footsteps rushed toward me.
On instinct, I put my left hand on Morte’s chest and pulled the
Sword of Eventide free. Red particles scattered from the blade as I
swung it, right as Black Hood Number Two leaped at me with his
dagger drawn.
Asuna was in pursuit behind him, but the man’s foot speed was
formidable, and she wouldn’t reach him in time. I stepped to the
right and held up my sword, preparing to meet the dagger even as
I kept an eye on Morte, in case he decided to throw his third pick
with his one good hand.
But Morte stayed down and immobile, and Black Hood Number
Two engaged in some unexpected strategy. He hurled his dagger
at me without so much as pausing to aim it.
A single swing of my sword knocked the spinning dagger aside.
Then Number Two threw something with his other hand.
It wasn’t a weapon, but a small sphere slightly over an inch in
size. I’d just seen the same object less than thirty hours earlier, so
I ran toward Asuna and shouted, “Stop! It’s a smoke bomb!”
There was a soft, deep boomf! behind me. I turned back as I
reached her and saw a curtain of smoke darker than night rising
to cover the PKers.
Even still, I could see the dagger man grabbing Morte’s right
hand and helping him up. Then thick smoke covered their
silhouettes, and I heard only faint footsteps racing toward the
forest to the north and out of earshot. The two orange cursors
blinked out at the same time.
I already knew the smoke screen didn’t confer any system
debuffs. So if I chased after them, there was a high possibility I
could take them both out for good—or at least the gravely
wounded Morte.
But my feet felt so heavy that my knees sank into the grass, and
Asuna made no move after them, either.
The cold night breeze swished through the trees, finally
dispersing the green poison gas and the fresh, dark smoke screen.
When the air had cleared, Asuna dropped her Chivalric Rapier
into the sheath at her side and muttered, “What did he mean,
124|P

‘Mamoru’? If he hadn’t said that, I wouldn’t have hesitated about
chasing them.”
While Morte had been suffering that continuous damage, Black
Hood Number Two had called him Mamoru. It was either a
nickname between comrades, or…I had to stop myself from
continuing that thought—and put my sword back where I
normally kept it.
“I was almost there, but I wasn’t able to go through with killing
him. When I drew my sword, I was so certain I would never let
him do the same thing again…”
“…I wonder if they’ll come back,” Asuna murmured.
I thought it over for a bit. “They probably will. And they’ll have
some new kind of PK scheme that we could never see coming…”
After I said that, I realized there was something else I should’ve
said right away. I turned to Asuna, looked into her curious eyes
for a third of a second, then looked away and bowed my head to
her.
“I’m sorry, Asuna. I knew the abduction event was going to
take us out of town in a paralyzed state, so I should’ve realized
this could happen…and because I wasn’t thinking straight, I
exposed you to danger. I’m really, truly sorry.”
Upon further reflection, I’d earned Asuna’s anger on numerous
occasions since our partnership began on the first floor. I couldn’t
even recall the exact number of times she’d thrown a pillow or
jabbed me in the side on this floor alone.
But this mistake was on a different level. If I hadn’t given her
my careless guarantee, backed by beta experience, that it was
“absolutely safe”—or if I’d just told her exactly what would
happen in the event—Asuna’s perspective without prior influence
might have noticed the danger of PKing it harbored.
The peril we just survived was clearly a situation that came
about because I was a beater. And I couldn’t guarantee that it
would be the last time.
“…I feel like I probably don’t have the right to continue being
your par…” I started to say until something soft brushed the sides
of my lowered head.

125|P

I realized they were Asuna’s hands. She pulled me upward,
forcing me to stand straight. The young woman glared right at my
face, not removing her grip.
“I’m going to tell you one thing I really, truly hate.”
“Y…yes?”
“It’s when two people know what each other are thinking, but
they decide to continue using vague, imprecise words to keep
everything at a distance and play oblique mind games. Yes,
softening things is valuable sometimes, but the really important
things ought to be said cleanly and clearly…don’t you agree?”
“Um…Wh-what are we talking about…?”
I understood the point Asuna was making, I just didn’t know
how it connected to the present situation. But with her holding
my head tight in both hands, I couldn’t even put a finger to my
cheek to ponder this.
“My question is,” Asuna said, sucking in a deep breath, “are you
saying you want to break up our partnership?”
With no escape from this direct fastball of a question, I had
little choice but to answer honestly. “If it’s a matter of wanting to
or not wanting to…I don’t want us to split up.”
“Okay. Well, neither do I…so that should be our conclusion.
Right?”
“………”
She is such a stud, I thought bizarrely. Asuna ruffled her hands
wildly over my head before letting go.
“Now that that’s settled, there are plenty of things we need to
talk over…What do you think we should do first?”
“Um…ummmmm…”
I sucked in a lungful of the cold, refreshing, midwinter air that
shrouded the forest to reset my mind and glanced around us.
We’d moved farther than I thought during the battle. The
packed dirt path was about twenty-five feet to the south of us. The
riderless carriage and horse were still on the road. It seemed like
we should do something about that, but I had no idea what. Plenty
of glittering objects littered the ground around the carriage, too.
Thousand-col gold coins, hundred-col silvers, and a wide variety

126|P

of items. All had belonged to Lord Cylon of Stachion before Morte
killed him.
“…How about we figure out what to do later but grab the stuff
Cylon dropped fir…” I started to say, before I realized something.
There was one item we needed to grab right away. I tore my
gaze away from the carriage and back to the grass. “Asuna, find
the ax and dagger they dropped!” I shouted.
Then I ran a few yards and leaned into the thick undergrowth.
It was around here, I was certain. I needed the spot where I’d cut
off Morte’s left arm; he’d had the poisoned pick in that hand when
it happened. And the moment his severed hand vanished, the pick
had…
“…Aha!”
I reached into the grass and carefully hefted a black piece of
metal stuck into the ground. It was a little less than four inches
long—and three-tenths of an inch at the thickest point—with six
sides that curved gently, prompting me to think of a type of drill
bit. From the middle to the needle-like point at the end, an oily
liquid seemed to be oozing from the inside of the spiral grooves.
I was curious to check its item properties, but the ownership
and equipment status of this pick were still with Morte, and I had
to do whatever it took to steal it from him. If they got to a safe
location and used the Materialize All Items command, the pick
would instantly vanish. And in fact, Morte might not even need to
bother with such a thing.
“I got them, Kirito,” said Asuna, trotting over with an ax in her
right hand and a dagger in her left. I consulted my mental list of
the various monsters one could encounter in the fields of the sixth
floor.
I knew there was one. One of those detestable creatures with
the same habits as the ratmen lurking in the catacombs of the fifth
floor. It was called…
“…Asuna, go and look in the surrounding forest to see if there’s
a monster called a Muriqui Snatcher.”
“Moo-reekee…? That’s a weird name. How do you spell it?”
“Uh, it’s tricky…M-u-r-i-q-u-i, I think.”
“Hmm…”
127|P

Even Asuna, whose knowledge sometimes seemed
encyclopedic, didn’t recognize that word. It occurred to me that I
should’ve looked it up in the two months between the end of the
beta test and the launch of the game. I scanned the woods on the
north side of the path but didn’t see any shapes that looked like
the monster in question.
Monsters weren’t designed to populate the areas right around
roads, even in the danger of the wilderness, but that only applied
when players were quiet and minding their own business. I’d
been worried that the screeching of the dagger user trying to save
Morte might have brought the monsters down upon us, but
fortunately—or in this case, unfortunately—there hadn’t been
any in range of his shouting.
That meant we’d have to go into the forest to find one, but
would it be in time? Morte and his group were already criminals,
so they couldn’t go into any town or village, making it difficult to
find a safe harbor—but they would’ve been aware of that when
devising this plan. If they had an evacuation area somewhere
nearby, it would come down to whether they reached it first—or
we found a Muriqui Snatcher…
“—rito. Hey, Kirito.”
The mention of my name caused me to snap to attention. My
partner was pointing not to the north, but behind me to the south.
I turned and looked to the darkened woods.
“Ooh…oo-ooh!”
The sound of calls vaguely humanoid and animalistic came into
hearing range, and I noticed a number of small silhouettes among
the tree branches. Above their heads, reddish cursors that
identified them as monsters sprang into being. There were ten—
no more than fifteen of them.
“Look! They’re all muriquis!” Asuna pointed out. Indeed, all of
their displayed names began with MURIQUI, but this was no
situation for celebration.
I was level 19 at the moment, and Asuna was at 18. This was
considerably higher than the needed level at the start of the sixth
floor, so all the cursors were only a pale pink color, but they were
numerous. And there weren’t just the Snatchers that I wanted, but
128|P

others like Muriqui Brawlers and Muriqui Nut Throwers were in
the mix as well. It turned out the man’s screech was quite
effective after all; he’d called down an entire pack of muriquis that
normally stayed deep in the woods.
All players in SAO were capable of producing the same vocal
volume, but because it sampled the actual voice of the player for
use in the environment, the tenor of your voice made a difference
in how well it carried. The dagger user had a hideous, shrieking
voice that refused to blend into the natural ambience and was
bound to carry farther, even in the noisy night forest. Being able
to gather a wide range of monsters just by screaming was an
effective ability for a PKer—not that I thought that was why he
chose to engage in the activity.
“So…what now?” Asuna asked.
It was directed at me, of course, but a number of the muriquis
descended from the tree branches down vines and trunks as
though answering that query. Hoo-hoo, they called, approaching
the abandoned carriage. Once out from under the tree canopy, the
moonlight illuminated their forms.
“Oh…they’re monkeys,” Asuna remarked. Indeed, the muriquis
were monkey-type monsters with furry coats, tails, and long
arms. They were much smaller than the apes that appeared in
higher floors and only four feet tall when upright, but they were
also very quick, and they made use of the trees to leap about in
three dimensions in aggravating ways.
Four of them had gone to the ground—three of which were
Snatchers with kangaroo-like pouches on their bellies, and the
last was a Brawler with a club-like stick in its hand. Asuna and I
could eliminate these four in an instant with sword skills, but
attacking would probably bring the other dozen down on us from
the trees. We’d been training and completing quests nonstop
since this morning, and just after this fight to the death against
Morte and his friend, I was sure that Asuna was more exhausted
than she let on. In order to permanently seize the mysterious
poisoned needle and their melee weapons, battle against the
muriquis would be unavoidable. The only question was how hard
to push ourselves.
129|P

As I mulled this quandary over, the trio of Snatchers
approached the rear of the carriage and began picking up the
coins and stuffing them into their stomach pouches. Asuna
seemed a bit perturbed by this.
“H-hey, they’re picking up Cylon’s things!”
“Yeah, that’s the idea,” I muttered. She glared at me skeptically.
Just then, the heavy ax dangling from her grip vanished with a
shwim! sound effect.
We were too late, I lamented—but then I realized that the
dagger and poisoned pick in my hands were still there. That
meant the two PKers hadn’t gotten to an evacuation point and
used Materialize All Items; Morte had just used Quick Change to
retrieve his main weapon, the one-handed ax.
Since the same thing hadn’t happened to these items, that
meant the dagger user didn’t have the Quick Change mod yet. Still,
the all-crucial poisoned pick was likely to vanish within the next
minute. All Morte had to do was switch the item registered to the
Quick Change icon from the ax to the pick, then use the skill again.
Better to let a monster pick it up than just have it taken away,
so I hurled it at the feet of the Muriqui Snatchers. I commanded
my partner, “Throw the dagger in the same spot!”
“O-okay.”
Asuna tossed the black dagger. One of the Snatchers
approached, hooting, and quickly scooped both the pick and
dagger into its pouch. They had the Robbing skill, so ownership of
the items instantly transferred, and neither Quick Change nor
Materialize All Items could remotely recover them. Once the pack
of muriquis finished taking all the items, they’d retreat deep into
the forest, so the odds were nearly zero that Morte and his friend
would find the right monkeys to defeat them and take their
weapons back.
I told myself that this course of action was for the best…and
turned to Asuna so that I could suggest we head back to town. But
before I could, she murmured, “I see. I finally understand…You
wanted to do the same method as when you got my rapier back
on the fifth floor.”
“Wha—?”
130|P

“Let’s beat them before they get away! You get the one with the
stick, Kirito!”
She is such a bundle of energy, I couldn’t help but marvel, before
I snapped out of it and hurried after my partner.
Once it was all over, I realized the pack of sixteen muriquis hadn’t
been as dangerous as I’d feared.
Because we fought them near the road rather than in the
woods, they couldn’t use their nimble simian evasion techniques
through the trees. The worst part ended up being the Muriqui Nut
Throwers tossing hard shells at us from behind, but once you got
used to them, it was pretty easy to swat the projectiles out of the
air. Also, the Snatchers usually ran as soon as you attacked them
when alone, but in a pack, they would stand their ground to the
end. This made it quite easy to ensure we got back all the items
the trio of Snatchers took.
If anything, the biggest problem for us was after the battle with
the monkeys, when Cylon’s large assistant plodded back out of the
trees. I’d completely forgotten about him, but now that the second
attacker had left him behind in the woods, he’d faithfully returned
to his carriage.
I was worried it would turn into another fight, but the man in
the gas mask simply plodded up to the box of the horse cart and
drove it down the road to Stachion without a glance at us. I wasn’t
sure if he even registered that his master was dead or not.
With all traces of the night’s events gone from the forest, Asuna
and I made our way back to Suribus, which was a closer trip than
Stachion at this point.
“……So sleepy……so tired……so hungry……”
As soon as we passed through the town gates, and the text
reading SAFE HAVEN vanished, Asuna slumped against the pillar
of the gate. Then she looked up at me and frowned.
“…What kind of an expression is that?”
“Oh…just that you said the kind of thing that I’d normally say
first,” I replied.

131|P

She looked at me for a few moments, aghast, then slumped
even farther. “You know…I can’t even bring myself to deny that
slander. Let’s just go to the inn…”
“Good idea,” I said, checking out the main street, which was
much quieter now.
If we’d proceeded through the abduction event as it was meant
to go, without Morte’s interference, we’d have been released in
Stachion after a brief scuffle and stayed at the inn over there. Now
that we were unexpectedly back in Suribus, we had to deal with
the issue of the overbooked inn rooms that Argo warned us about.
“Uh…well…I don’t think we’re going to find two single rooms
side by side…” I suggested warily.
Asuna blinked blearily at me and mumbled, “A two-bedroom
suite is fine…That was the original idea, remember?”
That was, indeed, what we discussed, but it was mostly to
protect against PK attacks, and now that Morte’s group wasn’t
likely to strike again for a while, it didn’t seem necessary for the
next day or two. On the other hand, the man in the black poncho
who was their ringleader didn’t make an appearance this time,
and the only lasting damage we did to them was mental and
material, so there was no guarantee they wouldn’t come back as
soon as tonight.
“Got it. In that case…I think there was a good spot on the left
bank of the river. Let’s try that one,” I suggested. Asuna mumbled
an affirmative and stood up unsteadily. She reached out toward
me, causing me brief panic when I thought she wanted to hold my
hand. Instead, she grabbed the end of my belt, which stuck out of
my coat.
So with Asuna on autopilot and allowing me to chauffer her
around, I took us to a four-story building close to the north gate. It
was an above-average inn for Suribus, and on top of it, all the
rooms had balconies facing the river, giving it the best view in
town.
The Jade and Kingfisher was about 80 percent full, probably
because of its unassuming signage, and if we didn’t care about
being adjacent, we could’ve taken two single rooms. But Asuna,

132|P

who was still clutching my belt, ordered the deluxe suite room
without a moment of deliberation.
My partner seemed to be completely out of batteries. I pushed
her up the stairs and opened the puzzle-free door to our room. A
huge window straight ahead showed us the night view of Suribus.
If we went on the balcony, we’d see the lights of the town
reflecting on the river below, but Asuna just staggered into the
center of the living room and glanced at the bedroom doors on
opposite walls.
“…I’ll take this one. Good night…” she said, yawning, and
vanished into the room on the left. I heard the sound of her
equipment being removed—and then silence.
I snuck up to the open door and saw Asuna, still in her regular
clothes, facedown on the spacious bed. After a few seconds of
hesitation, I entered the room and grabbed the edge of the sheet
cover beneath her.
I very carefully pulled it to roll Asuna over—she was already
fast asleep—so that she was faceup atop the sheets and pillows.
Then I laid the blanket back over her, whispered “Good night,”
and left the room. After a moment, I decided to leave her door
open.
Back in the living room, I exhaled.
It was, indeed, a deluxe accommodation. There was a very
fancy set of furniture in the middle of the room, with a basket of
fruit on the table between the sofas. I picked up a fruit that had
the shape of a kiwi and color of a strawberry and took a bite. It
had the texture of a banana, with a pineapple flavor.
As I ate, I reflected on the past.
When we stayed at a deluxe room in Zumfut on the third floor,
there was a fruit basket there, too. I recalled Asuna hurling a fruit
that tasted like a mix of apple, pear, and lychee at me—but even
though it was only two weeks ago, I couldn’t remember why she
had done it.
And yet, I could distinctly recall the conversation we’d had
there.
If I’m ever more of a hindrance than a help, you’d better tell me,
Asuna had said as we were lying down on adjacent beds. Her
133|P

reason for leaving the Town of Beginnings was so that she could
be herself…not so she could have me protect her.
Since that day, Asuna had worked tirelessly to continue
proving that statement true. She absorbed a massive amount of
information about how the game worked, she got better at
fighting, and she even got over her fear of dueling other players.
All I taught her at the dark elf camp this morning were a few
technical pointers and some tips about mind-set, and tonight
she’d held her own against Morte’s partner. If I was going to beat
her in a duel at this point, I couldn’t win with fundamental
abilities alone. I’d need to use some kind of higher-level trick.
So worrying endlessly about exposing Asuna to danger was, in
a way, an insult to her. But this knowledge didn’t help me stop
blaming myself.
I finished the fruit and opened up my inventory, scrolling
through the items in order of acquisition until I spotted the name
NAMNEPENTH’S POISON JAR (0). This was the little container of
poison gas that had paralyzed Asuna and me, as well as saved us
from danger, though it was now empty. I tapped the name and
moved it to the head of my item list, fixing its location through a
submenu. This way, I’d see the name every time I opened my
inventory and be reminded of my bitter mistake.
In Aincrad, poison—especially the paralyzing kind—was an
incredibly powerful weapon. Monster paralysis attacks could be
avoided with knowledge and experience, but it was almost
impossible to perfectly defend oneself against a malicious and
clever player armed with it. If we continued fighting against this
PK gang, they’d almost certainly put us in danger with paralyzing
poison again. But at the very least, I wasn’t going to let Asuna be
exposed to that danger a second time. Never again.
I closed my window and started to reach for the button to
remove all my equipment, but I thought better of it and physically
removed my sword and sheath from my back. I drew the sword
slowly to avoid making any noise and let the lamplight hit the flat
of the blade. Despite the furious battle against Morte and the
following slaughter of the muriquis, the thin Sword of Eventide
shone as brilliant and clear as a mirror.
134|P

When I had executed Rage Spike at the center of Morte’s chest,
the sword had curled and twisted like a living object to pierce his
heart—his critical point.
My two upgrades to Accuracy at the dark elf camp had kicked
in and auto-aimed it…that was all. But in that moment, and the
moment when it hit the core of the Annoying Wraith, the
correction process felt very much like the will of the weapon
itself. It wasn’t that the sword was adjusting its path toward the
weak point I was trying to hit, it was like the sword itself had
spotted the point of least resistance and wanted to slice that exact
target.
…I’m overthinking this. It only feels weird because I’ve never
used a weapon with an Accuracy upgrade on it before. Plus, it was a
good thing it hit Morte in the heart and put the fear of a one-hit kill
in him. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have picked up and run away like
that.
I ran my fingers along the flat of the blade, then returned it to
its sheath. This time, I hit the UNEQUIP button, and it vanished
into my inventory, along with the coat.
Now that I was lighter, I glanced back at Asuna’s room, thought
for a moment, then entered the bedroom on the right. I pulled the
top blanket off the bed and returned to the living room. I lay down
on the sofa, which was slightly hard, and wrapped myself in the
blanket. If I slept there, that put me in a slightly better position,
just in case someone found a way to slip through the system and
get into our room.
Asuna and I were equal partners, so acting like it was my duty
to provide all the protection was pure arrogance. Still, if there was
something I could do, I wanted to do it. I was sure that Asuna was
watching over me in the same way, in some form I didn’t even
realize.
I tapped the table to bring up the room menu and turned out
the lights. Closing my eyes, I thought I heard faint breathing from
the other room through the blue-black darkness.
I whispered good night to her and felt my mind sinking
somewhere very, very deep.

135|P

5
JANUARY 2, 2023.
Unlike yesterday, the morning sky was gloomy and dark—
though only visible through the strip of the outer aperture, of
course. Our day’s activities started with a bit of inventory
housekeeping.
After we ate breakfast at the inn’s restaurant, we returned to
the fourth-floor suite and materialized the items earned over the
previous day onto the table. The majority of items were materials
of uncertain use dropped by the muriquis, like Spider Monkey
Pelts and Fluffy Tails, but the real problem was what the late
Cylon had dropped. The gold and jewels had been picked up by
the Muriqui Snatchers before we retrieved them, so they were
mixed among our cash now, but we weren’t really sure if it was
right to use or sell off the equipable items he’d dropped.
“…I wonder if Cylon has any family,” Asuna murmured, lifting
up a gaudy golden pendant.
I shook my head. “No…I don’t recall there being a wife or
children in that mansion of his.”
“I see…But the bigger question is: Does this mean Cylon’s just
gone from Aincrad forever? Wouldn’t that mean nobody else can
start the ‘Curse of Stachion’ quest…?”
Again, I shook my head. “No…I doubt it’ll come to that. My
guess is that when he showed up at the hideout in Suribus, there
was already a different Cylon back at the mansion in Stachion. The
one that Morte killed was just ‘our’ Cylon. I bet that it won’t have
any effect on other players who are going to start the quest after
us.”
Asuna pressed her fingers to her left temple and groaned,
“Ugh…I just can’t wrap my head around that idea. The instanced
maps are hard enough, but having the same person in multiple
places at once is just…”
136|P

“I know how you feel,” I said with a laugh. I poured the pitcher
of lemonade-ish juice into two glasses and gave one to her. I took
a sip of the sugary liquid and continued, “During the ‘Elf War’
quest on the third floor, I’m pretty sure I mentioned how, in order
to get the Anneal Blade on the first floor, you have to do a quest to
gather medicinal ingredients from the forest for a sick girl. When
she drinks the finished potion, she gets better, but only while
you’re in their cabin. Once another player enters the place to start
the quest, they’ll just see a sickly, suffering girl again. It’s
unavoidable, you see…People would be losing their minds if only
the single earliest party could ever fulfill a certain quest. Still,
there’s just something jarring about it…”
“…Yeah, I know…”
Asuna took a sip of her juice, too. She puckered her lips, then
sighed.
“…I feel like Cylon was in pain, too, deep down. He was
Pithagrus’s first apprentice, but his master said he couldn’t inherit
the title, so he got mad and killed him and then had to bear that
secret for an entire decade, right? Plus, someone made off with
the golden cube that had his bloody handprint on it, so he knew at
least one person was aware of the truth…I have to believe that he
was on edge for all ten of those years.”
She was conjecturing as though Cylon were a real person.
As an NPC, I doubted he would feel any guilt at all because he
wasn’t programmed to. But thinking about it…Unlike in the beta,
the current version of Aincrad featured multiple NPCs that had so
much intelligence and emotion, they were almost
indistinguishable from people. Kizmel, Viscount Yofilis…and
perhaps Cylon, too.
Asuna leaned back against the sofa, exhaled, then continued, “I
thought…that maybe at the end of the quest, Cylon would repent
for his crime and accept his punishment…and perhaps even find
forgiveness…but so much for that. Hey, Kirito.”
“Hmm?”
“If we go back to Stachion, and we actually meet another Cylon
in the mansion there, the quest won’t actually continue where we
left off, right?”
137|P

“No…I don’t think it will. We didn’t actually finish that crucial
event, for one thing. I bet the quest log is still stuck partway
through that…”
I had my inventory window open already, so I switched it to
the quest tab and tapped on the ‘Curse of Stachion’ entry to make
it the active quest. The final line of the quest read…
“Let’s see…CYLON, LORD OF STACHION, HAS BEEN KILLED BY
BANDITS. YOU MUST FIND THE PROPER PLACE TO USE THE
TWO REMAINING KEYS.”
We stared at each other in silence. Then we both looked down
at the table. Among the various articles there were two keys, one
made of gold and one of iron.
“Wh-wha…? Hang on, was Cylon getting killed part of the story
of this quest…?” Asuna asked, but I shook my head several times.
“N-no, that’s not possible. Morte and his buddy weren’t NPCs,
they were other players. It says they’re bandits, but it’s not like
the SAO system was controlling them and making them do that.”
“Then why does the quest log say that?”
“Um…ummmm…The only thing I can think of is that they
considered the possibility that Cylon might be killed by another
player when the event goes in between towns and prepared that
message…maybe…?”
“Really?” she said, giving me a look of disbelief. “If they were
going to go to that much trouble, couldn’t they just make Cylon so
super-tough that nobody could kill him?”
“Well, that’s true…but then you’d have to wonder why
someone who wasn’t a fighter would be so strong, right? That’s
the kind of thing that SAO is really picky about…”
“True. I mean, they go to the lengths of printing the entire
contents of all the books in the world, even if we can’t read them,”
Asuna admitted. She put her glass of lemonade on the table and
picked up both gold and iron keys. “This golden key is the one we
found at the hideout, right? So…where do we use this iron key?”
“Dunno…The golden key goes to the dungeon underneath the
lord’s mansion, but I’ve never actually seen the iron one before…”
“Dungeon…? Is that where you find the golden cube?”

138|P

I wasn’t sure if I should answer that question or not, but then I
decided that since we’d already completely branched off the story
line I was familiar with, it couldn’t hurt, after all.
“Yeah,” I admitted, “the one who took the cube from the site of
Pithagrus’s murder and hid it beneath the mansion was the
former maid we talked to first. Her name was…Theano, I think.
She was actually a puzzle genius herself, and Pithagrus wanted to
make her his heir to the title.”
“Oh, really…? But Theano saw Cylon murder Pithagrus, right?
Why did she hide the murder weapon, rather than accusing him
as a witness?”
“See, the thing is, Cylon and Theano were lovers.”
“Oh, my…ooh, aah,” Asuna murmured as she took this in,
gazing at the keys in her hands. “Ten years ago…Cylon would be
in his late thirties, and Theano would’ve been around twenty-five,
I think. So maybe she didn’t feel like accusing her lover of murder,
but her conscience didn’t allow her to stand by and do nothing…”
“That’s about how it went, I think. Theano locked the golden
cube beneath the lord’s mansion, then placed the key to it in the
hideout in Suribus. She wanted Cylon to admit to his sin and atone
for it.”
“…What do you mean?”
“The dungeon under the mansion is a string of super-hard
puzzles, and you can’t even get to the last part without a hint from
one of the books in the study of the hideout. For ten years, Theano
waited for Cylon to admit to his crime and seek her help. She was
going to tell him the location of the second home if he did. In
order to get back the golden cube, Cylon would need to study the
books in the hideout as hard as he could and solve the puzzle
dungeon. And in fact, that’s the test that’s meant to determine if
you’ve got what it takes to inherit the title of puzzle king and lord
of the mansion.”
“Aha…but Cylon didn’t attempt the test himself, he just kept
hiring people to do it…”
“And paralyzing and abducting the people he hired, to boot,” I
noted.

139|P

Asuna let out a long breath. “If Morte hadn’t interfered…what
would’ve happened to us?”
“Cylon was going to lock us in the mansion dungeon to make us
retrieve the cube for him. But Theano found out, and she would
help us in the backstreets of Stachion, and from that point on,
we’d work with her on the quest, in the main route…”
“Hmm. Maybe we should ask Theano what to do with this key,
then,” Asuna suggested, holding up the iron one.
I tentatively agreed. “That would be…the orthodox idea. We
could also ignore Theano, use the golden key to go into the
dungeon and get the cube on our own. But I can’t predict how the
story will proceed in that case.”
“Well, no use wasting any time, then.” Asuna straightened up
with the keys still in hand, but I grabbed her sleeve and forced her
back into a sitting position.
“Hang on. We still haven’t finished the most important
investigation.”
“Huh? But the rest of this is Cylon’s stuff, right? Wait, you’re
not going to sell them, are y—?”
“No, no, no, I’m not. Although I bet this gas mask would go for a
pretty good sum…”
I briefly lifted the rather ugly leather mask Asuna had worn
last night when she’d snuck up on the dagger user, then put it
back on the table. Then I put all the equipment into the special
hotel-room item storage, clearing off the table so I could
materialize the dark metal throwing pick and the much-used
dagger.
Asuna grimaced when she saw them. “Oh, right…You were very
fixated on them. That reminds me, another one of them dropped
for me.”
“What?”
To my disbelief, Asuna opened her window and quickly
produced a new pick. Laid side by side, it was clear that in color,
texture, and curving hexagonal design, it was identical to the first.
Although this was surprising, I quickly realized that the first pick
of the set of three had missed me and vanished into the trees
when Morte threw it. A Muriqui Snatcher must have picked it up,
140|P

and when Asuna defeated it, the pick would’ve dropped into her
inventory.
“Ooh, nice combo work, monkey and Asuna.”
“That…doesn’t sound like a compliment,” she muttered,
grimacing again. “But…hang on…” She put a finger to her cheek
and remarked, “All the items we got from the muriquis went
straight into our item storage, right?”
“Yeah,” I said, wondering where she was going with this, but I
found that I had no answer to her next question: “Then why did
all of Cylon’s items fall to the ground when Morte killed him…?”
“Uh…mmm……”
She had a very good point. We’d survived because Cylon
dropped his Namnepenth’s Poison Jar within breathing range of
us. But shouldn’t it automatically have gone into Morte’s
inventory?
“Well, there are two possibilities I can see. Either Morte had
barely any space left in his inventory…or the rules for dropping
items is different when a player kills another player or an NPC.”
“…Morte’s probably very high-level, so I have my doubts about
the former.”
“That’s true. He’s bound to be limited in space because he
switches between sword and ax, but even then, I can’t imagine
that he planned to come attack us while being just under the
weight limit. So it might be a special set of rules…but there’s no
way for us to test that out.”
“How did it work in the beta?”
“I feel like it was the same as when hunting monsters…but I
didn’t PK, so I can’t tell you for sure…If we run into Argo
somewhere, we should ask her,” I said, putting a hold on the topic
of item drops and returning to the black pick on the table.
We’d gotten two of the three poisoned picks, but the real issue
was where they’d come from. I prayed there would be a hint to
the answer in the item properties and tapped one of them. Asuna
and I leaned closer to read the information.
“Um…it’s called a…Spine of…Sh…Shmargor…? I think?” she
hedged.

141|P

“What does that mean?” I asked. I’d been feeling like I was
using my partner as a walking English-Japanese dictionary, but
Asuna didn’t seem to be annoyed.
“Spine is probably like ‘thorn’ in this case. I’d assume Shmargor
is a given name, but I’ve never heard of it in the real world or in
Aincrad.”
“Mmm…”
I continued reading. The attack and durability ratings were a
bit higher than what you could buy at a store—but nothing
shocking. The real issue was the special effect below that.
“PARALYSIS (THREE): WHEN THIS WICKED SPINE STRIKES,
IT CONFERS A LEVEL-TWO PARALYZING POISON EFFECT. THE
POISON WILL WEAR AWAY AFTER THREE USES…Wow, level
two? We haven’t even gotten level-one paralyzing poison yet.
That means a level-one cure potion from an item store probably
won’t even work on this.”
“Then…what can you do?”
“Either level up the Mixing skill so you can craft level-two cure
pots or use a Purify Crystal…but…”
Asuna’s brow knotted. “How much proficiency do you need to
craft level-two potions?”
“About one hundred, I think.”
“Ugh.”
That reaction was so perfectly in line with what I would say
that I couldn’t help but side-eye her. Asuna recognized what she’d
done and turned a bit red, stammering, “A-and we’re not getting
any crystal items yet at this stage. So at the moment…there’s no
way for us to counteract the paralysis of this pick?”
“Um…well…”
The primary way to undo damaging or paralyzing poison was
by using potions or crystals, but that wasn’t the entirety of it.
Among the seemingly unlimited types of food and drinks of this
world were some with debuff-curing effects, and there was a good
variety of material items that provided curative and healing
benefits when used on their own. Then there were armor and
accessories that boosted poison resistance, and…

142|P

My mind was completely off on this tangent when Asuna
sucked in a sharp breath. She’d been reading the flavor text at the
bottom of the properties window.
“Oh…”
“Wh-what is it?”
“THE SUNKEN ELF GENERAL N’LTZAHH FACED THE DREAD
DRAGON SHMARGOR AND CUT OFF EVERY LAST ONE OF ITS
SPINES, WHICH DRIPPED WITH DEADLY POISON,” she recited, as
I followed the text. Apparently Shmargor was a dragon with
poisonous spines. But that wasn’t the crazy part.
The “sunken elf” was clearly referring to Fallen Elves. And the
individual named General N’ltzahh was someone Asuna and I had
witnessed in person.
“H…hang on. You mean this pick is a spine that General
N’ltzahh chopped off a dragon?”
“That’s what it says here…”
“B-but…why…?”
I had to pause there to get down the rest of my lemonade.
“Why does Morte have something like that?”
“You don’t think…he actually defeated General N’ltzahh…do
you?” Asuna wondered.
I thought it over and shook my head. “No…I can’t believe that.
You saw the general’s color cursor, didn’t you?”
“……Yeah.” Her cheeks went paler than usual.
We had witnessed General N’ltzahh in the Fallen Elf base
hidden deep in the submerged dungeon on the fourth floor. I was
level 16 at the time, and his cursor had looked pure black to me. I
wasn’t taken by even an instant’s desire to leap out of my hiding
spot and challenge him to a fight. Even now, ten days later and
level 19, I was certain that if I’d done so, both I and Asuna
would’ve been dead in less than a minute.
The Fallen Elf had been surrounded by an aura cold as ice, and
even expert player-battlers like Morte and the dagger user
wouldn’t stand a chance against him. In other words, if they were
tough enough to beat N’ltzahh, they could’ve easily killed us both
without needing to take advantage of that paralysis event.

143|P

“If anything…they’d either have to sneak into the Fallen Elf
hideout and steal them, or they got a very rare drop from one of
the lower Fallen Elves—the kind we were fighting…I think…”
I myself wasn’t certain about this at all. I decided to tap the
dagger next to the picks. When I read the properties that
appeared, my voice caught in my throat.
It was called the Dirk of Agony. Its special bonuses included
better poison and frost resistance, and a low chance of causing
bleeding damage to any target. The flavor text described it as “a
dagger given as a prize from the Fallen Elf Commander.”
“…A Fallen Elf prize?” I muttered. Asuna pushed my head out of
the way with her own to read the text, and she was similarly
shocked.
“Does this mean…it was a quest reward?”
“…”
I didn’t have an immediate answer for her question. The item
description didn’t suggest any other interpretation, but if true, it
would mean the dagger user received a quest from the Fallen Elf
Commander, finished it, and got this dagger as a reward.
And if that was the case, then Morte’s poison picks weren’t
stolen from a Fallen Elf, either, but they were likely given to him.
It was one thing if it was a quest that could only be performed
once, but in the off chance that it was a reward for a repeatable
vanquishing or gathering quest…that would mean the paralyzing
picks we’d worked so hard to steal were in practically limitless
supply.
“Hey, Asuna—” I said, right at the exact same instant that she
said, “Say, Kirito…”
We each used our eyes to motion the other to start, until
Asuna, who was slightly less patient than I was, finally gave in and
continued, “Well…I’m curious about the Stachion quest, but for
now, I think it’s smarter to investigate these picks a little more.”
“I was just about to say the exact same thing,” I said, which
brought a bit of a smile to her lips before they tightened up again.
“If they can keep getting these weapons, as many as they want,
that’s major trouble. They might not only go after us, and we’d

144|P

have to make sure that every last player fighting out in the
wilderness has resistance against paralysis…”
“I completely agree,” I said, “but like I mentioned before, we
have very few options for dealing with level-two paralysis poison
as it stands…so I think we should ask about that, too.”
“Ask…whom?” Asuna wondered.
I gave her a sly grin. “A knight who would know something
about the Fallen Elves and poisons.”
The circular map of the sixth floor of Aincrad was split into five
equal slices by steep lines of mountains, with a star-shaped lake in
the center.
Stachion and its neighbor Suribus were in the northeast slice,
and the labyrinth tower was in the adjacent southeast area, but
the rocky mountains in between were so tall they nearly reached
the underside of the seventh floor and blocked all passage.
Therefore, players needed to go around the floor in
counterclockwise fashion. The mountains were about a hundred
yards wide at their base, and the dungeons that served as the
passageway were fairly short. But they were packed with
annoying puzzles in each room, with a mid-boss waiting at the
exit of each area.
The DKB and ALS, the two main guilds on the frontier, had
switched from Stachion to Suribus on the very first day of the
floor. After half a day of leveling and updating equipment, then a
good rest at the puzzle-less inn, they were now planning to tackle
the cave in the adjacent northwest area—at least, according to the
message I got from Agil, leader of the Bro Squad.
At the time of that message, Asuna and I had been eating
breakfast at the restaurant and planning to go back to Stachion
before noon to finish the multi-part quest, after which we’d head
for the northwest area. But because of the weapons Morte and his
friend had dropped, our priorities had changed. We put our stuff
away, checked out of the Jade and Kingfisher, and headed for the
dungeon at the very south end of the area.
Although we left late and encountered a couple monsters along
the road, the two of us were still faster than a full raid party of
145|P

several dozen, so we could still see three groups milling outside
the dungeon entrance in its deep valley by the time we got there.
“Darn, I was hoping they’d have cleared out the dungeon already,
so we could just walk right through it,” Asuna grumbled as she
waited in the shade of the trees.
I considered this and suggested, “Wouldn’t it be the same thing
if we wait for them to go in, then sneak after them as they go?”
“There’s a huge difference between ‘We rushed but didn’t
make it in time’ and ‘We chose not to rush to make it there.’ Plus,
Agil’s group is over there already.”
Indeed, resting outside the dungeon were the eighteen
members (in three parties) from the blue-clad DKB, another
eighteen from the green-dressed ALS, and the four members of
the Bro Squad who wore varying armor but held exclusively twohanded weapons. At the end of Agil’s message, he’d said If you
have time, you can help us get through the dungeon, so the thought
of complaining about our own problems made me feel guilty.
“All right, I guess we should go,” I said, straightening up and
patting Asuna on the back. We headed into the narrow crevice
that led to the dungeon. As we walked past the sheer rock wall
with its odd relief carvings, I made sure to step as loudly as
possible to announce my entrance—and then waved to the Bro
Squad, who were closest to us, huddled around a small campfire.
“Yo—hey, guys,” I greeted.
“Good afternoon, Agil, Wolfgang, Lowbacca, and Naijan,” added
Asuna.
The tough guys greeted us in return, although they only smiled
at Asuna.
Silently cursing them, I sat down next to Agil. A quick glance
down the way showed me that Kibaou’s ALS and Lind’s DKB were
watching us with disgruntled expressions. I gave them a twofinger salute and turned back to the fire.
Unlike the real world, you didn’t need to know anything to
start a fire here, but finding high-quality logs for fuel was
surprisingly difficult. There were fallen branches all over in the
wooded areas, but if you wanted to make a good fire, you had to
146|P

tap them to make sure their item name was Dead Tree Branch. A
Living Tree Branch or Damp Branch would produce lots of smoke
and a weak, unstable flame. They sold bundles of good firewood
at the general store in town, but these were quite heavy and took
up space, so you couldn’t lug many around.
But thanks to the overall high Strength stat of the Bro Squad,
they had plenty of carrying capacity, and they were using nice,
store-bought logs. A metal tripod was set up over the fire, with a
kettle hanging from the top and emitting the scent of tea.
“How long is this break lasting, Agil?” Asuna asked. The man
said it would be about ten minutes, so I judged I had just enough
time and opened my menu to pull out a stash of sweet potatoes—
the proper item name was Ichthyoid Potato—I’d been keeping
since the fourth floor. I tossed three into the fire.
These food items were around in the beta, too, but they were
originally sold off at bargain prices, probably because it was the
half-fish monsters who dropped them. Since the fourth floor in
the beta was a place of dry, dusty canyons, the presence of fishy
creatures made them even creepier.
But once people found out that cooking them in a campfire
made them tastier than any store-bought sweets, the price shot
through the roof, and there was a potato rush as players
slaughtered the half fish for their starchy loot. Information wasn’t
getting around as quickly in the current form of Aincrad, so I
made a mental note to head back down to the fourth floor and
stock up soon.
The next thing I knew, it had been five or six minutes, and a
sweet smell was issuing from the campfire.
Asuna and the Bros paused in their chitchat, nostrils twitching,
but I let the sweet potatoes sit in the fire as long as possible—the
moment just before they got burnt for good was when they tasted
best—and with perfect timing, I pulled out my sword and jabbed
three quick times into the fire.
Sparks flew with the disturbance, but when I pulled out my
sword, there were three perfectly cooked sweet potatoes
skewered on its end. All five teammates held out their hands in
silence, so I cut each of the potatoes in half and handed them out.
147|P

The green-tea-style liquid that Agil had brewed went very well
with the half-fish potato. My hometown of Kawagoe in Saitama
Prefecture was a well-known area for sweet potatoes, and I’d
eaten them all the time since I was a kid. Therefore, I was both
picky about the taste and texture as well as a bit tired of eating
them, but even digital, I would give these sweet potatoes at least
ninety-five out of one hundred.
The potato halves soon vanished into virtual stomachs, and six
contented sighs escaped in unison. Wolfgang, who was planning
to open a steak house on the second floor in the future, asked me
where to get them. To avoid disillusioning him with the facts, I
simply said, “I’ll sell them to you for cheap,” and finished my tea.
The Bro Squad had surely fought some of the half-fish monsters in
the fourth-floor labyrinth tower, but the Ichthyoid Cultivators
that dropped the potatoes didn’t appear alone, and they ran away
once they got down to 50-percent HP, so the only reliable way to
beat them was to use a major skill at the right moment.
Thirty seconds before the end of the break, the campfire was
tidied up, and Agil let us into his party. The Bro Squad was just
four members at the moment, so Asuna and I could fit into the
maximum of six, but sooner or later they’d get more members,
and we couldn’t assume there’d always be a place for us. It was
occurring to me that I’d need to think about what to do when we
inevitably got bumped out of the raid group…when Asuna sidled
up next to me with a question out of nowhere.
“Hey, Kirito. How does a player with an orange cursor get it
back to green again?”
“Eh?”
Why would she ask that now?
I blinked but soon understood where she was going with it:
Morte and his comrade had slipped into the ALS and DKB by
hiding their identities, and they were using various tricks to pit
the guilds against each other. By the time I saw through their
scheme on the third floor, Morte had already left the guild, but my
guess was that the dagger user was still in the ALS.
But yesterday, he had attacked the NPC assisting Cylon, turning
his color cursor orange. So he couldn’t enter any town, and it
148|P

would make it very difficult for him to meet his guildmates. That
meant if there was any player among their ranks who had
abruptly vanished last night or who was still among the group
with some excuse for why he was orange, that was our man. But
only if he hadn’t gotten his cursor back to green at some point
over the course of the night.
“To go from orange back to green, you need to complete
something called an ‘Alignment Recovery’ quest. I don’t know
exactly how it works, but if your cursor turns orange, you’ll
occasionally come across NPC travelers or wanderers in the
wilderness, and they’ll give you a kind of trial quest…I think,” I
murmured, not entirely sure of my memory on the matter.
Asuna pondered this. “Is that something you can do in a night?”
“Apparently the difficulty and length of the quest changes
depending on your crime. Stealing something cheap from an NPC
might not need a very long quest, but if you attacked or killed
someone, that would be much more serious. And if you commit
the same crime again, the second time, the quest is harder than
the first, and the third time is harder than the second. I seem to
recall people saying that if you PKed about five players in the
beta, it was essentially impossible to be restored to green again.”
After all that, I realized I hadn’t actually solved Asuna’s
concern, so I added, “I don’t know how much it would take to
repair the dagger guy’s alignment, to be honest…Plus, he attacked
the big man, but he didn’t kill him…”
“Yes…and another problem is that only half of the ALS is
here…”
“I kind of doubt they’d take us seriously if we explained the
truth, too…”
We were interrupted from our hushed conversation by a loud,
booming voice coming from the dungeon entrance.
“Hey, if you wanna tag along, yer welcome! But if you join the
raid, you gotta follow our commands!”
It was a voice I’d never mistake for anyone other than the
leader of the ALS with the morning-star hair spikes, Kibaou. I
flashed him an okay sign, and he snorted and turned back to the
entrance. Among his three parties were some familiar faces:
149|P

Okotan the halberdier and Liten the full-plate girl who had helped
us with the last boss fight. They made little motions to catch our
attention, and Asuna and I bowed back.
Clearly, it had been decided that the ALS would take the lead
on this dungeon, as DKB’s Lind, Shivata, and Hafner led their
parties behind the other guild without a word of complaint, and
the Bro Squad, with their two extras, brought up the rear in
similar fashion.
Kibaou confirmed that all parties were in order and boomed,
“Let’s get through this place an’ eat lunch at the next town!”
The ALS members cheered heartily—the rest of us at half the
volume—and the forty-two-man group of conquerors headed into
the dungeon that split the mountain range.
In less than twenty minutes, we were infighting.
The dungeon itself was very simple, made up of large rooms
and the hallways that connected them. We cleared out the ten
Living Statue monsters that appeared in the first chamber without
much trouble.
The problem arose when we reached the puzzle lock on the
door at the back of the room.
It looked like a sliding puzzle—in Japan, these are often called
daughter-in-the-box puzzles—with blocks in large, medium, and
small sizes that could be slid around. To beat the puzzle, you had
to maneuver the large block placed at the very top of the puzzle
all the way to the exit at the bottom. But while in the beta test
there was one large block, four vertical blocks, one horizontal
block, and four small blocks—a fairly easy orthodox example—
the puzzle on the door now was longer—with eight small blocks
in total.
Naturally, it was Kibaou who confidently made the first
attempt. But after five minutes, and at least three hundred moves,
he was nowhere nearer to solving it, and Lind, who was getting
tired of waiting, suggested he give up and let someone else try.
Kibaou yelled at him to stay out of it, and eventually the DKB and
ALS had taken sides across the room in a glaring contest.

150|P

“Well…this certainly looks familiar.” Asuna sighed in
exasperation as she leaned against a distant wall. “Say, isn’t there
a simple and reliable way to solve that, like with the fifteen
puzzle?”
“Unfortunately, there isn’t…I remember that the shortest
solution to the original version was eighty-one moves, but this
one has four extra blocks on it. I don’t think I’d be able to step in
and do it smoothly.”
As we spoke, Kibaou was busy clattering the metal blocks as he
slid them back and forth. But he was merely finding himself back
in the same spots he’d been in minutes earlier, and he was getting
no closer to a solution.
“By the way, Kirito, the puzzles in Stachion were some curse
from the lord of the town, right? We didn’t do that quest, so I don’t
know the fine details,” said Agil, joining our conversation.
I looked up at his craggy face and nodded. “Someone died at
the lord’s manor, and now the place is cursed.”
“Then why are there puzzles in this dungeon that’s miles away
from the town? There wasn’t a single one in Suribus.”
“…That’s a good point.”
I’d always known the sixth floor as the one with puzzles, so I
never thought further about it, but now that he mentioned it, if
the curse didn’t even extend to Suribus, it didn’t make much sense
that it was afflicting this dungeon farther away. In fact, the
puzzles spread to the south area across the lake and to the
labyrinth tower as well, and I didn’t recall anything in the beta
that rationalized this.
Well…it’s all just a setting someone made up, I concluded
lamely, and I was gauging if I should say it aloud when someone’s
voice interrupted me.
“Hey, you just reset it to the beginning!” Lind bellowed,
drawing our attention.
Indeed, on the massive sliding puzzle that opened the stone
door, the large block that was meant to escape from the bottom of
the puzzle was back to its starting position at the top. As he
fiddled with the long vertical blocks below it, Kibaou grunted,
“When you get stuck, you start over! It’s common sense!”
151|P

“You just admitted you got stuck! So let someone else have a
go!”
“I didn’t say that!”

152|P

153|P

“Yes, you did!”
Exasperated with their bickering, Asuna commented,
“Sometimes I get the feeling that they’re actually best friends.”
“You might be right about that…”
“Oh, just go over there and solve the puzzle for them already,
Kirito.”
“L…listen, there’s a whole extra row added to what was there
before. I can’t beat it with the moves I remem…”
But then I came to a realization: Yes, there was an extra row of
blocks, but the difference was just four new single-size blocks at
the bottom that were the most maneuverable type, so in fact, they
could largely be ignored. All you had to do was get the large block
down to the spot where it was originally supposed to go and then
slip two of the small blocks around the sides of it, creating a path
to the exit.
“Um…”
Asuna was grinning.
“…Well, I guess I’ll give it a try.”
Agil smirked.
Leaving the pair behind, I crossed the large chamber to the
locked door. Kibaou and Lind both noticed my footsteps and
turned to me, ready to object, but I held up my hands to cut them
off.
“Listen, there’s no trick to this puzzle other than memorizing
the moves. I’ll do this one, and if you can remember how I do it,
then you should be able to do it in a snap if you come across the
same thing.”
The two clamped their mouths shut, then shared a quick
glance. Lind nodded, while Kibaou turned his back on me.
“Well, if you say so, then I’m willin’ ta let you try.”
“Then if you’ll pardon me…”
I approached the puzzle that Kibaou had just reset and started
working on it, relying on memory. I’d said there was no trick to it
other than memorization, but in general, the quickest method was
to gather the long vertical blocks on either the left or right side,
then eventually get them to take up the top rows. Thankfully, I
managed to inch the largest block downward without getting
154|P

stuck, until it was at the original exit position. As I theorized, once
the block was there, it only took a few moves to adjust the new
blocks out of the way and slide that large block to the bottom
spot.
“Ooooh,” the crowd of players murmured, as the massive door
sank into the floor, offering us passage into the hall beyond.
“Let’s get movin’!” Kibaou said triumphantly, leading his
guildmates through.
Part of my showing off was on Asuna’s request, but there was
another purpose for it, too. As the ALS passed, I casually began
strolling with them until I could approach a mustachioed dandy in
their back row.
“Hiya,” I whispered to Okotan, the captain of the ALS’s
recruitment team. He glanced at me and murmured, “Nice work.”
“Thanks. Listen…I hate to ask this out of the blue,” I began,
prompting a curious look from him, “but of the members
originally slated to participate in this dungeon, did anyone drop
out abruptly just beforehand?”
But the truth was that I was already expecting to hear a certain
name as Okotan’s answer.
The man who gave me the nickname of Beater after beating the
first-floor boss, the man who tried to have Nezha crucified for his
part in the weapon-upgrading scandal, the man who claimed
Asuna and I were trying to monopolize the “Elf War” questline on
the third floor, the man who stayed away on the fourth floor but
accused me of trying to get the guild flag for myself at the fifthfloor boss, the man with the catchphrase “I know the truth”—the
man named Joe. I’d found myself suspicious of him on a few
separate occasions, and when he wasn’t among the ALS members
in this dungeon, my suspicions grew deeper.
The only things Joe shared in common with Black Hood
Number Two were that they both used daggers and were about
the same height. Number Two had his hood pulled low last night
and also when I spotted him in the catacombs—and Joe always
wore a leather mask that hid his face, so neither of them actually
showed off his features. Their high-pitched voices were similar,
too, but masks could change that, so it wasn’t a reliable detail.
155|P

But on the fifth floor, Kibaou had said to Joe that the
information he’d brought about the guild flag was accurate. That
meant that at the very least, Joe had access to beta information,
which could have come from Morte, who was a tester. The ALS
had a few other dagger users, and much like Morte, there was no
guarantee that Number Two wasn’t switching his primary
weapon while he was working with the ALS—but if Okotan
mentioned Joe’s name, my suspicion would turn almost to
conviction.
“Well…” Okotan started, seemingly without any suspicion and
with his eyes darting up to the left, where the list of his raid
members would be. He shook his head. “No, nobody changed their
plans. Everyone who signed up at yesterday’s meeting is present
here.”
“Oh…I see,” I said, without any visible reaction. On the inside,
however, I was taken aback.
Morte and his pal must’ve known, in planning last night’s
attack, that they would become orange players because of it. Even
if their plan was to complete an “Alignment Recovery” quest
overnight to get back to green, Number Two had lost his special
Dirk of Agony in the act of saving Morte. If he hadn’t thrown it to
distract me, I would have smashed the smoke bomb away with
my sword in the instant before it exploded.
Losing the powerful weapon he’d received from the Fallen Elf
would be a major blow to his battle power, and such a loss might
affect his ability to complete the recovery quest before morning. I
had assumed that if Number Two was Joe, he would come up with
some excuse for why he suddenly couldn’t take part in today’s
activity—but it turned out that Joe was never scheduled to be
here.
I needed to get as much information as I could while I had the
opportunity. “Um, what time of day did you have that meeting,
exactly?” I asked.
“It was after dinner, so probably around eight thirty in the
evening,” Okotan said. At last, he seemed to find something
suspicious about my questioning. “Why would you want to know
something like that?”
156|P

“Er…well…Late last night, we saw someone who looked like
they were in the ALS fighting out in the woods, and they were
struggling. I was just concerned, that’s all…”
I knew it was a weak explanation, but in fact, I wasn’t really
lying—I just wasn’t going to reveal that his opponents were me
and Asuna.
Okotan took this at face value, however; in fact, he even bowed
a bit. “Oh, I see. Thank you for your concern. I didn’t hear anything
about any members being in trouble last night, so I don’t believe
there was a problem.”
“Oh, good,” I replied, pondering this.
If the meeting was at eight thirty, it would’ve been after nine
when they finished. The attack on us happened after nine; if our
second attacker was, in fact, Joe, he couldn’t have been at the
meeting.
I wanted to know if Joe was there or not, but asking as much
would be fishy at this point. And even if Joe wasn’t at the meeting,
that merely increased my suspicion without giving me any hard
evidence.
If only I could figure out the reason why Joe wouldn’t be taking
part in this dungeon run today, when he’d been in every single
boss fight thus far…
“Yo, the next room’s up ahead! All members prepare fer
combat!” Kibaou shouted from the head of the line. His ALS
followers brandished their weapons. I decided there wasn’t much
point trying to talk further and thanked Okotan before I drifted
back.
Once the DKB had filed past and I was in the rear again, Asuna
zeroed in on me. “What were you talking with Okotan about?”
“I was asking if any of their members backed out from this at
the last minute.”
Asuna instantly understood where I’d been going with that.
She leaned closer. “And…?”
“Sadly, he said there weren’t any.”
“……Oh…I guess it wasn’t going to be that easy to catch him by
the tail…”

157|P

“Yeah. At this rate, we should keep our wits about us all
throughout the day.”
“What do you mean?”
I leaned over. “The truth is that it’s not actually too hard to
cover up the reason you went orange. He could have said he used
an area attack that accidentally hit an NPC—and gotten his
guildmates to help him do the ‘Alignment Recovery’ quest. The
reason he didn’t is probably because he considered the possibility
that the attack last night wouldn’t work. He could trick his
guildmates, but if you or I survived and learned that someone in
the ALS turned up orange, we could confirm that he was our
PKer…And if they’re savvy enough to plan that carefully, they
could have decided that we’d let our guard down, thinking they
won’t attack again the next day, making us easier targets this
time.”
“…When you put it that way, it seems likely. So assuming that
we’ll be watching our backs more carefully from now on,” Asuna
contemplated, leaning in very close with an angry glare, “I’d like a
correction to your quote just now about ‘if you or I survived.’”
“Wha…?”
“Why would you think that if one of us was killed, the other
one would run away? Say it again, but correctly: ‘if you and I.’”
“O-okay…”
I wasn’t planning to abandon Asuna and run away, of course,
but I did think it possible that I might need to use myself as a
shield to help her get away…and if I dared to suggest it out loud,
I’d get more than an angry glare in return. So I agreed with her
and started to correct myself—when I heard a crude whistle from
behind us.
“Things are getting steamy over here!”
“They’re melting the North Pole!” taunted Lowbacca and
Naijan of the Bro Squad. Almost instantaneously, Asuna and I
were no longer touching shoulders and leaning our heads in, but
keeping a healthy distance.
I couldn’t help but think, I didn’t taunt Shivata and Liten that
way, because I told myself that being in ninth grade meant I was too
old for that!
158|P

We managed to get through four of the large rooms—each of the
door puzzles being the same type, in increasingly complex
arrangements, but we got through them all despite Kibaou and
Lind’s bickering—until the final chamber greeted us with a huge,
vine-plant boss. It rapidly grew pods that hurled explosive peas at
us, until Agil and Lowbacca charged in with their battle-axes to
cut it free from the roots, at last.
I didn’t get the Last Attack bonus, as I was busy dodging the
explosives, but according to Agil, all he got for it was a huge bunch
of peas. With great sympathy, I suggested that maybe they’d be
sweet if boiled. Once out of the dungeon, we split off from the rest
of the frontliners.
The ALS, DKB, and Bro Squad headed over the western horizon
toward the faint silhouette of the next town, but Asuna and I had
another destination in mind: The dark elf fortress on the sixth
floor was located in this northwest slice of the map.
“…I don’t think there’s much use in complaining about the map
design of Aincrad at this point,” Asuna said after a few minutes of
walking off the path through the wilderness, “but when there’s
only a single line of mountains between us and the first area, it
really shouldn’t be this different.”
“No arguments from me,” I replied.
The northeast area that contained Stachion and Suribus was
mostly thick forest, like the third floor, but adjacent to it on the
map, the northwest area was burnt-red desert, just like a western
movie. There was no verdant plant life on this rolling terrain, just
weathered rocks and the oddly shaped cactus here and there.
When a particularly strong breeze started, it kicked up sand into
little whirlwinds that impeded your vision.
Hunger and thirst couldn’t kill you in Aincrad, but in the real
world, you’d never set foot in a place like this without more than a
few bottles of water. Our destination was near the aperture
directly north, after a hike of about two and a half miles. And
there was no path to take, so we had to avoid dried riverbeds and
rocky outcroppings along the way, while battling the many
monsters that appeared.

159|P

Fortunately, my partner failed to find the giant scorpions, giant
centipedes, and giant camel spiders to be quite as icky as the
astral monsters, despite the fact that most girls would absolutely
hate them. And just when my inventory was getting close to full
with unappetizing ingredient items like scorpion tails and camel
spider jaws, I finally hit the milestone of level 20.
“Yahoo!”
The moment the level-up light surrounded me, I raised my
right fist and leaped into the air in celebration. Asuna, who had
reached level 19 not that long ago, backed away a foot.
“S-since when did you start acting like that?”
“I also did this when I reached level six and level twelve,” I
insisted.
At last, Asuna recognized the occasion. “Oh, so you got another
skill slot…In that case, some congratulations are indeed in order.”
“Yahoo!”
“Sure, sure, sure. So what are you taking for your fifth skill?”
“Mamma mia!” I cried, realizing I was getting a bit carried away
just as my partner abruptly hit me with an ice-cold stare. I cleared
my throat in embarrassment.
“Currently, I’ve got one-handed longswords, martial arts,
Search, and Hiding…so I think I’ll either go with Throwing Knives
or Sprint…”
“I recommend Sprint,” she said. “It cuts down on movement
time, and it just feels good to run.”
“Yeah, I like that skill, but…”
I considered that it had been a month since we started working
together, and that it was probably okay to ask by now, but even
still, I felt hesitation.
“Say, Asuna…you’ve got rapiers and Light Metal Armor and
Tailoring and Sprint, and what’s the other one?”
At level 19, Asuna only had four slots still, but thanks to the
ultra-megaton rare item that was likely unique among the entire
world, the Crystal Bottle of Kales’Oh, she could effectively use a
fifth skill. From what I knew, she was using the bottle to switch
between Tailoring and Sprint, so whatever she had in the final
slot had been a mystery all this time.
160|P

Asuna blinked three times at the question, and to my surprise,
she looked up and away from me, pursing her lips. That only
made me more curious, but I never would have predicted her
reply.
“Um…it’s a secret. I don’t want you to get mad at me.”
“H-huh?! Get mad? …Me? Hang on, I’m not going to get
mad…Though, I mean, whatever skills you choose are your own
business…”
“The teachers who say that are the ones who get the angriest.”
“T-teachers…”
Well, she might be right about that. But I’m still not a teacher.
Asuna took advantage of my silence to jab her finger at me. She
continued, “We’re not talking about me right now. I was asking
you what skill you’re going to take.”
“Uh, r-right…Well, I think it’ll either be Throwing Knives or
Sprint, but I’ll hold off for now…”
“I see. Well, let’s keep moving,” she commanded, turning her
gaze to the north without chastising my lack of decisiveness. I
guess she really didn’t want to talk about her fifth skill.
For the last few minutes, we’d been walking in sandy canyons
that reminded me of the American state of Utah—based on
movies, not any personal experience, of course. The terrain was
monotonous but complex here, and consulting the map didn’t tell
you much except for which direction you were traveling, but the
only way to reach our goal was to get through this natural maze.
As long as we knew the proper route, we could run straight
there and avoid all the monsters, but even a beater like me, who’d
only run the maze once several months ago, didn’t have the layout
memorized. We just had to keep pressing forward, slaughtering
all the scorpions, centipedes, and Mongolian death worms that
crawled out of cracks in the dusty canyon walls. The light trickling
into the canyon was getting darker and thicker by the time we
finally came across a sign of civilization.
Suddenly, the canyon floor was wider, and many stone pillars
lined the way, with stone blocks placed like a bridge over the fine
sand. There was a large gate ahead of us, atop which streamed a

161|P

multitude of banners with a familiar insignia of scimitars and
horns.
“…Wow, that is huge…”
Asuna was tiring from all the constant battle, but even she
couldn’t hide her reaction to the distant castle gate. Level-wise,
she was still plenty strong for this area, but the combination of all
these poisonous monsters and the wariness of fresh PK attempts
had only amplified the mental toll.
We couldn’t just stay on guard for these PKers all the time. We
had to think of proactive ways to remove the threat they posed, I
told myself as we headed over the stone bridge.
“Castle Galey up there is the largest of the dark elf fortresses.
The building itself isn’t as posh as Yofel Castle, but they’ve got a
dining hall and a bath.”
“Wait, you mentioned a bath?”
Asuna didn’t jump into the air with a “Yahoo!” but the change
in her expression suggested her energy meter had shot from 30
percent up to 70 or so. She picked up her pace, and I hurried to
match her, eventually deciding I ought to elaborate.
“The thing is…the dining hall is great, but there’s something
about the bath that might be a problem…or might not…”
“……What is it?”
“Wellll, it’s, uh, actually…public…”
Asuna didn’t understand what I meant at first. She repeated
“Public…?” a few times, then scowled. “Is this like the antonym of
instanced? So it’s not a space that’s just for us? Other players can
come in?”
“That’s right. Out of all the dark elf spots, only the queen’s
castle on the ninth floor and Castle Galey up there are public…I’m
guessing they found it difficult to have a whole bunch of these
fortresses and castles all existing in the same space at the same
time…”
“Well, Yofel Castle was plenty big, too. But I guess I can’t
complain…So your point is that other players might enter the
dining hall and bath and stuff,” she said. I could practically hear
the effervescence of her energy meter decreasing, so I hastened to
clarify.
162|P

“In theory, yes, but the only people who can pass through that
gate are ones doing the ‘Elf War’ questline with the dark elf
faction, who are at least as far along as we are. I don’t think
there’s a single other player who qualifies at this point, so go
ahead and bathe to your heart’s content…I could even stand guard
outside, like I did on the third floor…”
Asuna appeared to grapple with this idea but abruptly shifted
into dead seriousness. “And the dark elf castle is definitely not a
safe haven, right?”
I was briefly taken aback, and I glanced up at the gate, which
was much closer now. The anti-criminal code that promised
absolute protection over a player’s HP and life was invisible, but
there was something different about the air surrounding the
castle when compared to human towns. I looked back at her and
nodded.
“Yeah…I believe so. It’s theoretically possible for Morte’s gang
to get inside and attack us somehow. But like I said, they’ll need to
be involved with the dark elf faction to do that. I don’t think they
had that much time to work with…and at the very least, it would
be impossible for J—for the dagger user infiltrating the ALS.”
Asuna’s eyebrow twitched when I started to say the name, but
her reaction didn’t go beyond that. Her suggestion involved an
unexpected character. “Do you think…Viscount Yofilis would tell
us if we asked? Could he say if Morte or his friends were working
for the dark elves?”
“Hmm…”
I came to a stop without realizing it, crossing my arms.
Eventually, I shook my head. “No…Yofel Castle is an instance, so
Viscount Yofilis should exist in different states for each party
working on his quests. According to our Viscount Yofilis, he’d
probably say we’re the only humans assisting the dark elves in
their struggle.”
“Oh…Once again, I have to say, I don’t like that system,” Asuna
opined with a shrug. She turned to the tall castle gate. “We’d
better be on guard in the castle, then. C’mon, let’s go.”

163|P

“Yeah,” I agreed, and my partner and I crossed the last bit of
the stone bridge to approach the huge gate, which appeared to be
carved out of one single, giant rock formation.
In all previous camps and forts, there had always been guards
at the entrance, but there was a special reason that Castle Galey’s
elves almost never ventured outside. Instead, sharp voices issued
forth from the bay windows atop the gate.
“Begone!”
“This gate does not open for the likes of humankind!”
These warnings were even harsher than those at Yofel Castle.
But by holding high the Sigil of Lyusula ring that Viscount Yofilis
gave me, I caused the guards at the bay windows to turn around
and signal behind them. A clear, crisp bell began clanging from
somewhere within the castle, and the gate slowly opened.
It would take nearly a full minute for the gate to open all the
way, so once there was space enough for a person to get through,
I prodded Asuna to go on, then followed after her. The instant we
crossed the threshold, the gate reversed motion and began to
rumble closed.
Asuna took three steps before she stopped and exclaimed,
“Ooooh…!”
Castle Galey was built—more like sculpted—out of a circular
basin over six hundred feet across. The three-story castle curved
along the inside walls of the basin, but rather than being built of
stone or wood, it was carved directly out of the natural rock
formation like some ancient ruin.
Surrounding the castle in a C shape from east to west along the
north side was an open area covered in tile mosaics, with dark elf
guards and servants quietly coming and going. I didn’t see any
players at the moment.
Standing in the center of this open space was one massive
hardwood tree. The desert and canyons we’d walked through to
get here featured no plants aside from brown cacti, but the
branches of this tree burst with vivid green leaves. A natural
spring welled up with crystal-clear water at its roots, sparkling
golden where the sun dripped through the branches.

164|P

Near the base of the tree was a large hollow knot, and if I
squinted, I could see a faint, pulsing blue light inside it. When
Asuna noticed it, she whispered, “Oh…is that…a spirit tree…?”
“Yeah. There’s a spirit tree in the castle here.”
The spirit trees were like teleporters that the dark elves and
forest elves used to get from floor to floor, much like the gates we
players had. But while our teleport gates could always be found in
the biggest town on any floor, many of the spirit trees were placed
far from any elven fort or castle, which I found curious at first.
Apparently, the spirit trees had a life span and grew anew
every hundred years or so, but even the elves didn’t know where
they would sprout. The spirit tree on the sixth floor, however, was
an outlier in its longevity and had been living for centuries even at
the time they built Castle Galey around it.
I was explaining all this background information to Asuna
when the door on the west wing of the castle opened loudly.
Suddenly, Asuna’s face burst into a brilliant smile.
“Asuna! Kirito!”
Greeting us and rushing over was a female knight wearing
black-steel armor and a dark cloak, with a curved saber on her left
hip. Her skin was a brilliant brown, and her short-cropped hair
was grayish-purple.
Asuna walked forward and threw her arms wide. The knight
leaped into them and circled her hands around the fencer’s back.
After more than five seconds of this embrace, she turned to me
with open arms. I’d been going in for a handshake, so I had to
stifle my shyness and accept her bear trap. Somewhere in my
head was the mysterious statement that It’s through heavy metal
armor, so it’s okay.

165|P

166|P

The knight’s embrace lasted another five seconds before she
let go, stepped back, and clapped my shoulder. It was only three
days ago that we parted, but it felt like it had been so much longer.
I greeted the member of the Pagoda Knights Brigade of Lyusula,
the beautiful dark elf who was our good friend.
“Kizmel, it’s good to see you.”
“It is indeed, Asuna and Kirito. I’m glad you’ve come…It must
have been difficult to cross this arid land on foot,” she said.
Asuna beamed. “It was nothing, knowing we’d see you at the
end.”
“I’m happy to hear you say that. Please, come inside and clean
off the dust of your journey…but only after you’ve paid your
respects to the liege of the castle. I’m sorry to delay your rest…”
“No, if we’re going to enjoy the hospitality here, we must show
our appreciation,” I said. Kizmel looked apologetic but proceeded
to escort us across the open square.
Reflecting on it now, between the camp on the third floor, Yofel
Castle on the fourth, and Shiyaya Village on the fifth, the dark elf
NPCs had never been openly hostile to us, but they’d been
standoffish in general. It seemed that the quests we’d been doing
for them had begun to affect their attitude, because as with the
camp when we visited yesterday, the various guards and servants
we passed in the open area gave us polite salutes. It could’ve just
been because we had the elite knight with us, but I returned the
gestures all the same. We headed to the left of the spirit tree—to
the front gate of the castle.
The main body of the castle was a story taller than the wings
and jutted about fifteen or twenty feet above the cliffs that
surrounded the basin. I visited this place during the beta, but I
merely accepted the main quest and reported back when I was
done, so I didn’t have strong memories of it.
But when I passed through the guarded doors into the main
hall, I couldn’t help but join Asuna in her admiration.
The exterior of Castle Galey was carved from the reddish rock,
with detailed design but a uniform texture that didn’t convey the
same beauty that Yofel Castle did. But on the inside, it had finely
laid black-and-ivory tiles and no hint at all that it was some
167|P

archaeological ruin. I felt as though the interior was decorated in
a simpler fashion during the beta, so either Argus’s designers put
hard work into spiffing up the place, or the dark elves had.
We crossed the perfectly clean hall—not a speck of dust to be
seen—and ascended the double-spiral staircase to the lord’s
office on the third floor. The castle’s master, Count Melan Gus
Galeyon, was the extremely rare elf who was large and hearty,
with a splendid beard. But he did not possess the same humanity
(elfanity?) as Viscount Yofilis, and his dialogue was rather generic
as he welcomed us with a main quest and three sub-quests.
When we left his chamber, Kizmel joined us in exhaling with
relief. I stared at her profile without realizing what I was doing,
and she gave me a guilty smile. “I am of common birth. Since
receiving the duty of recovering the hidden keys, I have had more
interactions with nobles, but it is not something one gets used to.”
“Ha-ha, I’m a commoner, too. I get nervous around important
people. I don’t know about Asuna, though.”
I had suspicions that Asuna was quite a pampered rich girl—
despite her propensity for instant violence—and the fencer gave
me a jab to the side, sure enough. “Of course I’m an ordinary
civilian, and yes, I get nervous!”
“Ha-ha-ha. You two get along so well. Well, let me show you to
your room.”
Kizmel placed a hand on each of our backs and pushed us west,
down a windowless hallway. We soon reached a guest chamber
on the third floor of the west wing. On the opposite wall from the
door was a lattice window, through which the sun setting over the
horizon—make that the outer aperture of Aincrad—was bright
red.
“Ooh, it’s such a lovely room!” exclaimed Asuna, doing a full
turn at the center of it.
“It’s a bit smaller than the guest room at Yofel Castle, I know,”
Kizmel began, “but it’s actually the second-best in all of Castle
Galey.”
“No, it’s not cramped at all! I bet you could fit five people on
this sofa alone!”

168|P

Asuna was showing signs of furniture obsession. She undid her
equipment and plopped herself onto a long, wood-framed sofa
with an elegant curved design. Kizmel grinned, removed her
saber, and sat next to her. I got rid of my sword and armor and
sank into an armchair across from them.
The suite at the Pegasus Hoof, where we talked to Lind about
the guild flag, had been quite deluxe, too, but the castle of a count
was quite naturally a level or two above in terms of quality
furnishing and plushness of cushions. It seemed like a waste that
Asuna and I were the only players stopping at this castle…and
then I realized I had something to confirm first.
“Listen, Kizmel.”
“What is it?” asked the knight, who was reaching for the plate
of fruit on the coffee table between us. I chose my words carefully.
“Well…are there any other humans aside from us at Castle
Galey, do you know?”
Suddenly, the smile vanished from Asuna’s face. But Kizmel
simply said, “No, there aren’t.”
“Oh, I see. Sorry for being weird,” I said, relaxing. I picked up a
star-shaped fruit from the dish.
“But I have heard of other human swordsmen assisting the
people of Lyusula,” she continued. “Perhaps you will come across
them someday.”
I froze in an awkward position, fruit held just before my open
mouth.
Nearly two months had passed since the start of this game of
death—and over two weeks since we opened up the third floor—
so it wasn’t strange at all that there would be other players
undertaking the “Elf War” quest on the dark elf side. But if that
just happened to be Morte and his friends, there was no
protection here at Castle Galey against their malice.
Morte slaughtered Cylon, lord of Stachion, without a moment’s
hesitation. So if they wanted to, they would try to do that to the
dark elves in this castle…and to Kizmel, too. In pure fighting
power, Kizmel was overwhelmingly stronger than them, but there
was no overlooking the wicked creativity of a motivated PKer.

169|P

We would need to fulfill our purpose for being at this castle as
quickly as we could, I decided. I made eye contact with Asuna,
then tossed the fruit in my mouth and opened up my game
window.
What I pulled from my item storage, which the elves called
Mystic Scribing, were the double-sided dagger and the two
throwing picks, which shared a certain kind of cruelty in their
design. As soon as she saw them arranged on the table, Kizmel’s
face tightened.
“…Kirito…what are those…?”
“Um…we were attacked by two fellow humans last night. They
dropped these weapons in the attempt…”
Kizmel was already on her feet. “You were attacked?!” she
yelled. “Was it just attempted robbery, or…?”
“Uh…I think they were trying to kill us…”
“……My word…!!”
The dark elf’s onyx eyes glowed with pale flames—or so it
seemed to me. She stood up straight, grabbing the saber she’d left
standing against the side of the sofa, and shouted, “If I were there,
I would have lopped their heads from their shoulders! Kirito,
Asuna, you must not return to your human towns! You must stay
with me…”
“No, no, no, we’re fine,” I assured the furious elf, getting her to
sit back down. I pointed at the weapons on the table again. “We
managed to drive them off without suffering much dam…er, any
wounds. But they’re very persistent, so there’s no question
they’re still out to get us. The problem is the weapons they were
using…Especially these, which are poisoned throwing needles.
Can you tell us anything about this, Kizmel…?” I finished, all in a
single breath, sliding one of the picks over to the knight.
“……”
Kizmel stood her saber against the sofa and lifted the pick high
over her head, so that it caught the light from the window.
“…This isn’t steel. It was fashioned from the spike of some
living thing,” she said.
Asuna leaned forward and tapped the other pick. She read the
flavor text on its item properties out loud. “Kizmel, these human
170|P

words say, THE SUNKEN ELF GENERAL N’LTZAHH FACED THE
DREAD DRAGON SHMARGOR AND CUT OFF EVERY LAST ONE OF
ITS SPINES, WHICH DRIPPED WITH DEADLY POISON…”
“N’ltzahh…Shmargor…?!” she repeated, rising again and
initially hurling her hand with the pick away from her, before she
regained her composure and placed the weapon on the table. She
gave us both a look, then began to speak in an officious tone.
“…Shmargor is an evil dragon spoken of in elven legend. Long
in the past, when the elves and humans and dwarves still lived on
the earth, a wicked little snake snuck past the priestess and
climbed the black Holy Tree to take a bite of the single fruit that
grew at the tip of one of its branches. The snake gained eternal
life, but it was cursed so that everything that entered its mouth
turned to poison. Every time it ate, the snake suffered and died,
only to come back to life through the fruit’s holy power. After
several centuries, the snake had evolved into a massive, ugly
poison dragon that attacked towns and villages. But the human
hero Selm defeated it, and it fled to the land of ice far to the
distant north…”
Kizmel’s rich voice faded out, prompting both me and Asuna to
exhale. Her smooth and lyrical delivery was so pleasant to listen
to, we wanted to ask her to tell us more, even though we knew
she couldn’t.
“…Hmm, that’s kind of a sad story…I doubt the snake wanted to
bite the Holy Tree’s fruit out of malice…” Asuna said, shaking her
head.
Kizmel nodded deeply. “The fruit of the Holy Tree is said to
give eternal life, and its sap provides invulnerable flesh. Many
tragic tales revolve around such fruit. There is this story, for
example: At the end of the Month of Holly, which humankind
designates as December, there is a holy sage tasked with the duty
of giving gifts to children. One year, he learned that the gift he was
to give to a sickly little human girl was actually a piece of the Holy
Tree’s fruit. Unable to stifle his curiosity, he opened the present
box and found an unbearably gorgeous crystal. The sage desired
this crystal, and of all the thousands of children, he only failed to
deliver that one little girl’s gift. Without the protection of that
171|P

crystal, the girl did not live to see the new year as she was meant
to, and so the holy sage went mad, cursed to wander forever
through a night that never ends…”
“…Do the other stories have similar endings?” Asuna asked.
Kizmel shrugged. “Most of them do. The gifts of the Holy Tree
are not to be coveted.”
“And from what I remember, the Fallen Elves were banished
because they tried to harvest the sap of the Holy Tree,” I
interjected, which caused Asuna to gasp.
“Oh, right! The Fallen Elves were sent to the far north, too. So it
would make sense that he encountered Shmargor up there…But
wait, does that mean General N’ltzahh has been around since
before Aincrad was created…?”
Kizmel frowned in silence while we talked, so I cautiously
asked her, “Um, in fact…how many years ago did Aincrad come
into being…?”
“…Actually, we royal knights do not know the details. As I
believe Lord Yofilis told you, only Her Royal Majesty possesses all
the legends surrounding the Great Separation and the six sacred
keys. All we are told is that this floating castle was created long in
the past.”
She paused for a moment there, brushing the clasp of her cloak
before continuing, “However, I have heard that Her Majesty and
the forest elf king are very long-lived. So perhaps the man who
leads the Fallen is equally ancient. Not that he frightens me.”
That was a heartening attitude, but I didn’t want Kizmel to end
up fighting General N’ltzahh. I had no doubt of her skill as a
knight, but even remembering the sight of N’ltzahh up close left
me short of breath. He would be worse than anything we’d faced
so far, including the five floor bosses.
Though Kizmel couldn’t have known what I was thinking, she
fixed me with a long look from her dark eyes and reached for the
table again. This time, she picked up the black dagger that
Number Two had dropped—the Dirk of Agony.
Unlike with the pick, Kizmel merely gave this a once-over, then
stated, “Indeed. This is a Fallen weapon.”
“You can tell just by looking?” Asuna asked, wide-eyed.
172|P

The knight indicated the base of the thin blade. “Do you see the
symbol carved faintly down here?”
“Huh?” I yelped. I felt ashamed that I hadn’t noticed it when I
examined the weapon at the inn in Suribus, but sure enough, just
above the hilt, there was a very fine carving that glinted orange in
the sunlight. The design was of two folding lines that created a
pattern of three diamonds, but I had no idea what it meant.
“What is this…?” Asuna wondered.
“It apparently represents ice and lightning,” Kizmel answered.
“Ohhh,” cooed two humans in unison.
The dark elves had a scimitar and horn, the forest elves had a
shield and longsword, and the Fallen Elves had ice and lightning.
In a different game, you’d figure the Fallen were masters of ice
and lightning magic, but sadly—well, luckily, really—there was no
magic in SAO.
Kizmel put the dagger back on the table and crossed her
slender arms over her chest. “These are, indeed, weapons of the
Fallen. The same mark was on the blades of those we fought on
the third and fifth floors. But I seem to recall that the sigils I saw
were not simple carvings, but cast silver.”
“Now that you mention it, I think that’s right…” Asuna agreed,
but I couldn’t honestly remember. I found it hard to believe that
an AI like Kizmel would be mistaken, so I moved on from there.
“You’re saying…this dagger is cheaper than the weapons of the
Fallen we’ve fought to this point?”
“I would say so, but that is not all of it. I suspect these are
weapons given to collaborators of other races…Meaning that
those human vagabonds who attacked you did not steal that
dagger from a slain Fallen, but they were given them for their
assistance.”
“……”
Asuna and I had discussed that very possibility based on the
flavor text of the Dirk of Agony this morning. I felt like Kizmel’s
statement turned that vague suspicion into almost verifiable
truth.
Morte and his buddy had found a quest route that involved
collaborating with the Fallen Elves, rather than fighting against
173|P

them. So we ought to assume there would be a way to regain
those highly deadly poisoned picks. If we were going to keep
fighting them, we needed a way to counteract level-2 paralyzing
poison as soon as possible.
I drew in a breath to explain this, but I was beaten to the
punch.
“Do not worry. As I told you earlier, as long as I am at your
side, no vagabonds will threaten you,” Kizmel stated flatly. She
patted Asuna’s knee lightly and stood up.
“Uh, K-Kizmel, we’re not…” I started to say, but she only sat
back down to motion us to stand with her.
“Why don’t we wash off the dust of your travel first? You must
have taken on quite a bit of sand during your trip to this castle.”
Those words turned Asuna’s eyes into hearts—or more
accurately, into the symbol for hot springs. Nobody would be able
to stop her now.
I quickly stashed the weapons back in my inventory and
hurried after the women.
When I visited Castle Galey in the beta, I took a tour of the
building. A stint in the baths wasn’t on the tour, but I did
remember the location of the facilities.
But Kizmel didn’t head to the second floor of the east wing,
where I remembered it. She descended the stairs in the center of
the west wing. I found this confusing—but not as much as when
we continued descending even past the ground floor. Weren’t we
going to the bath? Was there even a basement in the beta…? But
the knight’s pace was utterly confident.
The stairs ended on the basement level, turning into a tiledfloor hallway lit by oddly colored lamps. As we walked, the chilly
air gradually grew warmer and warmer.
Eventually, there was a large door on the right-hand wall. It
wasn’t adorned with a hanging curtain with the word for bath on
it, like in Japan, but the open doorway was exuding white steam,
so it was definitely the right place. In the real world, a place that
steamy underground would get as moldy as you could possibly

174|P

imagine, but we didn’t have to worry about microorganisms or
viruses in the virtual world—I hoped.
When Kizmel and Asuna passed through the door, I stopped
and called out, “Okay, I’ll wait for you here.”
The knight swung around and beckoned to me, looking hurt.
“Don’t be silly, Kirito. Come in with us.”
“Um…I’d feel bad if I forced you two to wear swimsuits like at
Yofel Castle…Plus, on the one-in-a-million chance that those
vagabonds attack again…”
Asuna looked exquisitely conflicted, trapped between her guilt
at being the only one bathing and her desire to bathe properly in
the buff, but Kizmel had no hesitation whatsoever.
“Do not worry about an attack,” she said. “This castle can only
be entered through the gate to the south, and when it opens, the
bells can be heard all throughout the castle. And you need not
worry about the other matter.”
“Huh…?”
“Here, come and see.”
She grabbed my arm and yanked me through the doorway.
It was a kind of rest lounge, decorated all over with attractive,
leafy plants and tables with rattan chairs on either side wall.
There were also pitchers and glasses for water. There were no
other dark elves here, probably because it was still early. There
were also two rattan doors on the far wall that likely led to the
bath. There was a circle on the left door and a square on the right.
“The bath in this castle is very large, so there are separate
entrances for men and women. You will not need your
‘swemsoots’ here, Kirito and Asuna.”
“Oh…th-that makes sense…” I said, relieved. In that case, I
wasn’t opposed to relaxing in a nice huge bath. I didn’t have
anything against baths.
“We will see you later, then.” Kizmel grinned. She and Asuna
vanished through the circle door, waving, so I pushed my way
through the square entrance. As I expected, there was a changing
room next. It seemed appropriate to the fantasy genre that in
addition to wicker baskets for holding clothes, there were also
armor hooks. But thanks to my art of Mystic Scribing, I could just
175|P

hit the UNEQUIP ALL button to have my clothes spirited away
into storage. After a quick check to make sure no one else was
around, I removed the last piece, too.
Using the provided white towel for the minimal level of
defense, I headed through the next door. The tiled hallway turned
left, leading toward…
“Ooh…”
It was a fantastical enough sight to elicit a murmur from me.
The space was a massive dome with a radius of probably thirty
feet. The gently curved walls and ceiling were clearly carved
straight from the bedrock, but that just accentuated the natural
hot spring feel. There were niches in the walls at even intervals,
containing lamps that provided soft light to the chamber.
Under the dome was milky liquid of an opal-white color, and
something that looked like a thick vine hung directly from the
middle of the ceiling all the way down to the water. This dome
was probably located right beneath the open plaza on the surface,
which would mean the vine was a root of the spirit tree.
I put the towel in my inventory and set foot on the first step of
the bath, allowing the heat to fill me up to the top of my head. This
time, it elicited a “Fwaaa…” from my mouth. It was too shallow to
get my whole body in, though, so I headed toward the center,
parting the lingering steam as I went.
Near the root, it was as deep as my waist, so I finally dunked
down into the water.
Just then, the white steam in front of me gave way, revealing
another figure at startling proximity. It was too deep for me to
leap out of the way, so all I could do was stare.
In general, I was not a person with a lot of reliance on
regulations, self-control, or personal rules—but even I had a few
things I demanded of myself.
One was never to think If only I had (not) done this or that. It
was important to understand the reason things happened to
ensure I didn’t repeat my mistakes, but I considered worrying
about Why did you say that, or If only I’d realized this, or If I’d just
started my homework earlier to be nothing more than a waste of
my limited mental resources over time.
176|P

But even I, in this one instant, couldn’t help but consider a
whole cornucopia of possible actions that I’d failed to take:
If only I’d been satisfied with the edge of the bath. If only I’d
realized why the huge bath was a dome. If only I’d more closely
considered Kizmel’s description: There are separate entrances for
men and women. If only…
If only I’d instantly closed my eyes, turned around, and claimed
“I didn’t see anything!” maybe there would have been a different
result.
But what I actually did was stare, dumbfounded, for about
three whole seconds at the female player standing barely two feet
away with all her equipment removed. My eyesight auto-aim
kicked in, going first from the collarbone down to the pelvic bone
submerged in the water, then back up, until I finally saw her face.
At this moment, there was only one other player in Castle
Galey aside from me. So naturally, this person staring equally
dumbfounded back at me was my partner of about a month, Miss
Asuna the fencer.
Wow…after all that trouble, we’ve beaten five floor bosses in a
month. At this rate, we could be on the tenth floor by mid-January, I
thought, my mind grasping for anything other than the reality I
was facing: Asuna’s neck, jaw, and then nose turning fiery red.
When the color reached her hairline, she grunted “Nngh!” and
raised her arm with a violent splash. Upon seeing her clenched
fist, I thought, Well, I suppose I’ve earned this one, fair and squa—
No, no, no, wait!
I couldn’t accept that punch. This castle wasn’t under the anticriminal code. If level-19 Asuna hit me with a full-power punch
while I was unarmored, she would do damage to my HP, and that
would change her cursor color to orange. Normally, when we
were out of town, she carefully adjusted her jabs to play nice, but
the gloves were literally off now.
“W-wait, no!” I yelled, but the God of Fury before me could hear
no human words.
“Hnnngggg!” she roared, and before she could unleash her fists,
I took the one option that would avoid her being designated a
criminal player.
177|P

I toppled forward, not backward, and folded my arms around
her body, then pushed her into the water, sending up a glorious
plume of hot water. We sank nearly three feet into the cloudy
bath.
I clutched the struggling girl, who continued trying to scream
even under the water. I wanted to yell “You’re going to turn
orange!” but the only sound that came out of my mouth was
“Bwuh-bubbu-ba-beww-bowah-glurble-gurlurgle!”
Naturally, the Drowning icon showed up above our HP bars,
and with the way the air was escaping our mouths, HP loss wasn’t
far off. We couldn’t let ourselves die for such a pathetic reason, so
I pulled us up enough for our heads to breach the surface, still
holding Asuna. This would be my final chance to warn her about
going orange…
Then a deluge of freezing-cold water poured onto us from
above, literally cooling our heads. I froze in place, completely
bewildered. It was Kizmel, who had no doubt come to the bath
later due to the process of manual armor removal, looking down
on us. “Well, well, aren’t we friendly?” she commented.
Naturally, she had not a single piece of equipment on, but by
this point, I didn’t have any mental power left to reflect on it.
Later on, I was told that the spirit tree at Castle Galey was
constantly sucking up the natural hot spring water through its
roots to support its branches and leaves, occasionally becoming
so quenched that it dripped like rain to form the pool at its base.
The cold pool steadily seeped into the bedrock, and every hour or
so, it poured into the underground spring like a waterfall.
It made a certain kind of sense—and also made no sense at
all—but the point was, it saved us from a variety of potential
troubles. Asuna’s class temporarily changed from Fencer to God
of Fury, but when she remembered that we weren’t in a safe
haven, she realized what my actions were meant to do. She cycled
through five or six different facial expressions before she said, “I
apologize for doing that” and went back to being human again.
I sank down to my shoulders and considered what to do now.
The water itself was almost completely opaque, so if you stayed
178|P

five feet apart, you couldn’t see the other person’s body
whatsoever, but I didn’t have the willpower to sit back and enjoy
my bath, even under those circumstances. It seemed that I should
just equip the swimsuit Asuna made for me on the fourth floor,
but for some reason, she was just soaking in a daze without doing
the same, so I felt a bit hesitant to open my window.
In the end, I decided that simply finding a way to peel off and
get out of there was best, and I was scooting off to the side when
Kizmel, who was soaking on the other side of Asuna from me,
started speaking.
“You know, about those throwing picks…I think I may know a
way to counteract the poison that seeps from them.”
“Wha…?”
That was exactly what I’d been hoping to ask her about. I
scooted several inches closer out of sheer fixation—until a hard
stare from Asuna held me at bay.
“If those throwing picks are indeed fashioned from the spikes
of the dragon Shmargor, then the story of the human hero Selm
fighting the dragon should be useful to consult. As I recall, Selm
gained the assistance of an elven sage and constructed a tool to
stop the dragon’s poison…”
“Ooh…and how do you create that item?” I asked, leaning
forward again. This time, Asuna was paying attention to Kizmel,
so I didn’t attract her ire.
“Was the sage a dark elf or a forest elf?”
Kizmel replied to these questions with a short shrug. “I heard
the story from my grandmother when I was a child. I’m afraid I
don’t recall the finer details. But I believe a dark elf storyteller
would have a full and proper recollection of the story of
Shmargor.”
“S-storyteller? Where can we go to meet such a person?”
Please, please, let it be somewhere on a floor we’ve already
cleared out, relatively close to the main town! I prayed. It was
answered with surprising helpfulness.
“There is a storyteller in this very castle. But as a general rule,
they are very old and spend most of the day sleeping, so you will
need to visit the library around the middle of the day.”
179|P

“Nice!”
I just barely held back from throwing in a “Sweet!” as well. It
wasn’t confirmed yet that we’d be able to craft an antidote, but
even the possibility was welcome.
As for Asuna, she found her interest drawn to something else.
She turned to face Kizmel, rippling the surface of the bath.
“I’ve never seen an elderly elf before…Are they youthful in
appearance, too?”
“Our elders rarely venture outside the city; that is why. As for
their appearances…Well, I find that a difficult question to
answer.”
“Oh. Of course. I’ll just look forward to finding out in person.”
“That is a good idea. I think I’ll get out now. What about you
two?” the knight asked. We looked at each other for the briefest of
moments, then agreed that we were done, too. I turned around,
still crouched, and headed for the men’s dressing room—though
it didn’t make sense to me why you’d have separate dressing
rooms that led into the same bath. But before I left, one last
question crossed my mind, and I turned back around.
“Oh yeah, Kizmel—”
Into my line of sight leaped the upper half of the standing
knight—and Asuna desperately using both hands to cover her up.
I quickly averted my eyes.
“Hmm? What is it, Kirito?”
“Uh…I-I’ll ask in the lounge! Um, s-see you later!”
I quickly beat a breaststroke retreat across the bath for the
stairs before any further attacks could come my way.
One of the nice things about SAO was that wet hair and skin dried
very quickly upon leaving the water. So I didn’t need to towel off
as I headed down the dark hallway to the changing room,
equipped a black shirt and pants, and entered the lounge. The
women weren’t back yet, and no one else was visiting the place,
so I slumped lazily into one of the rattan chairs along the wall and
heaved a deep sigh.
I had no issues with bathing in general, but it had been the
source of trouble more than once or twice since I partnered up
180|P

with Asuna: I had to wear a skimpy suit with a bear logo on it in
Yofel Castle, and there, I got my head dunked. I had to guard
Asuna while she bathed at the dark elf camp on the third floor,
where Kizmel barged in on me. Nothing much happened on the
second floor, but on the first…
“Actually…I think bathing was the start of all this…” I muttered,
pouring water from the pitcher on the table into a glass and
drinking it all down.
As a matter of fact, when we first met, Asuna hadn’t removed
her red riding hood for anyone, and the moment when it first felt
like the distance between us was closing the tiniest bit was when
she came to the place I’d been renting out in Tolbana on the first
floor of Aincrad. Her visit was to use my bath.
With exquisitely poor timing, Argo the info dealer arrived
while she was bathing, having run across her while trying to slip
into the bathroom to change equipment. But if I hadn’t been
renting out a place with a deluxe bath in the first place, we might
not have ever found ourselves working together.
So no matter how many times it led to incidents, I couldn’t hold
ill will against the baths of Aincrad…I just needed to make sure I
knew the men’s and women’s baths were fully separate next time.
The swinging door with the circle mark on it opened, and
Asuna and Kizmel returned. The fencer was wearing a yellow
tunic I’d never seen before, while the knight was in a shimmering
purple gown—both noticeably more sheer than their usual
clothes, which flustered me at first (even though it seemed
unnecessary to get worked up about, after what had just
happened in the bath).
Fortunately, Asuna’s memories of that disaster had been
overwritten by the pleasure of her first Aincrad bath in a natural
hot spring. She threw herself into the rattan chair on my right, a
look of bliss on her face, and said, “Ahhh…that was good…”
I handed her a cup of cold water, which she gulped down.
“Pweeh!”
Kizmel sat in the chair on my left, elegantly folding her long
legs, and said, “It is indeed quite a splendid bath we have here. It

181|P

is a shame I will have to move again, once my duty on this floor is
over.”
“I see. You’ve got a busy life, Kizmel…You’ve got the, um…Jade
and Lapis and Amber Keys stored in a safe location, right?”
“But of course. They are in the treasure repository on the
fourth floor of the central hall.”
“T-treasure repository, huh…?”
I’d sure like to see that. But I bet it’s the type of place where I’ll
get yelled at, I wondered selfishly, but Asuna had a much more
practical thought in mind:
“Kizmel…aren’t you worried that the forest elves might attack
in search of the keys again, like they did at Yofel Castle?”
This was a very good question. Thick stone walls and massive
gate aside, this place would make a significantly easier target than
Yofel Castle, which was surrounded by water on all sides. The
forest elves had put so much effort into seizing the keys back, it
was hard to imagine them giving up after one defeat.
There could be enemy soldiers sneaking up outside the gates
even as we sat here. The disquieting thought nearly got me up out
of my seat.
“…No. You need not worry about that,” Kizmel stated. Both
Asuna and I stared at the side of her face. Something in the faint
gloom of her expression told me the source of her certainty.
“Oh, I see. The area outside this castle…”
“That’s right. The wasteland that surrounds us is so desolate
and dry…that neither dark elf nor forest elf can last within it for
long. Inside the castle, we are protected by the blessings of the
spirit tree, but if that tree was to die out, we would be forced to
abandon this place.”
When I visited Castle Galey in the beta, the dark elf who gave
me the quest—neither Kizmel nor Count Galeyon, just a nameless
commander—told me the same thing. I took it at face value at the
time, but now it only brought fresh questions.
“But then, how will you get the key on this floor back? You can
telep…er, travel through the spirit trees at the castles on the fifth
and seventh floor, but the key is still far from this place, isn’t it?”

182|P

“That’s correct,” she admitted. There still seemed to be a faint
note of mourning on her features, but when she turned to us, she
was wearing her usual languid smile. “But do not fear. This castle
is equipped with a means to leave in the case of a sudden
emergency. It will allow us to cross the arid wastes.”
At that, my partner and I shared a meaningful look. We didn’t
need to speak aloud to understand each other.
“Kizmel,” Asuna said, “Kirito and I will retrieve the hidden key
on this floor. We might not be as strong as you, but we’re much
tougher than we used to be.”
“I do not doubt that,” the elf replied, looking hesitant, “but I
cannot expect you to do the job for me. The friction with the forest
and Fallen Elves is our problem…And think of it this way. If you
had not saved my life in the Forest of Wavering Mists, I would
have been killed by that forest elf—or we would have fought to
our mutual deaths, at best. How can I be allowed to stay safe and
sound in a castle while allowing you two to do all the dirty,
dangerous work?”
“Just like this, that’s how!” I wanted to shout, but the look on the
proud knight’s face prevented me. Asuna appeared to have more
to say on the matter, but I waved her back and said, “All
right…then let’s go and get the key tomorrow. But don’t take
unnecessary risks. If any of it seems tough, you must promise to
tell us at once.”
I held out my left pinkie finger, which Kizmel stared at.
“What is wrong with your finger?”
“Oh, uh…It’s a human custom. When you make a promise, you
intertwine your pinkies.”
“Ah. Like this?”
Kizmel hooked her right pinkie around mine and moved her
hand up and down. Asuna got up from her chair saying “Me too!”
and held out her right hand to Kizmel, who used her free hand to
do the same, smiling awkwardly.
“It is a strange custom, but it feels fun. I promise not to take
unnecessary risks, if you promise to prioritize your own safety.”
“Of course!” Asuna and I replied in unison. The knight beamed.

183|P

After the underground bath, she led us to the dining room on the
second floor of the central hall.
It was dinnertime, and many elves were present. There was
even a small stage, upon which two elves in fanciful costumes
were playing a lute and flute. Some of the soldiers were even
singing quietly along to the tune.
The food itself was noticeably simpler than the full-course
meal at Yofel Castle, but this way suited my taste better, and the
stew of tubers and meat on the bone was good enough that I
asked for seconds.
After deciding when we’d meet in the morning, we said goodbye to Kizmel at the third-floor hallway of the west wing—even
though the knight’s room was just next to ours—and returned to
our guest chamber. We let out heavy breaths and found ourselves
glancing at each other.
It felt like I needed to apologize for my scandalous behavior in
the bath, but Asuna was sending a silent signal for me not to say
anything at all. My game window said it wasn’t even eight o’clock
yet, which, on a typical day, meant I’d head back out for some
night activity, but we were tired from the dungeon spelunking
and crossing the wasteland today and agreed that we should get
an early bedtime.
But we failed to realize that we hadn’t yet faced the greatest
peril of the day.
This guest chamber was another suite, where the living room
was located in a separate area from the sleeping area. But unlike
the place we stayed the night before, there was only one bedroom
door.
We looked at each other again, then crossed the living room
and opened the door. The bedroom was equally decadent, but
there was just one queen-sized bed in the center of the room.
Last night, I’d slept on the sofa rather than my bed, so I could
just do the same thing—except that was because Asuna had fallen
fast asleep first. Knowing how my partner hated to be given
special treatment, I suspected…
“Um…I’ll just sleep on the sofa, okay…?”
“You’re not going to get a good night’s sleep that way.”
184|P

I would’ve protested, but she was actually right, and she knew
it.
While sleeping in SAO, the player’s real-life body was in a sleep
state as well, but the NerveGear kept faithfully sending virtual
bodily signals all the while. If you slept on a fancy bed, you would
feel the softness envelop your back. If you slept outdoors on the
ground, it would be rough and uncomfortable. Naturally, the latter
would provide shallower sleep, often failing to result in anything
more than a surface-level snooze.
The sofa in the living room was large enough, and its mattress
was nice and thick, but because the seat cushions were mounded,
it wasn’t suitable for lying down on. When I was soloing on the
first floor, I camped out all the time—with a blanket, at least—so I
could sleep on this, but whether Asuna accepted that or not was a
different matter.
“Listen, I can sleep anywhere. Don’t mind me, just take the bed
and—”
“We are game partners, aren’t we?” Asuna interrupted.
She was correct, of course.
“Y-yeah?”
“So it would be wrong to place all the burden on one of us.”
Again, she was absolutely correct.
“…Y-yeah.”
“Then this is the only option.”
She dragged me by the sleeve into the bedroom and peeled
back half the covers on the large bed. Right in the center of the
perfectly pristine white sheets, she drew a line two feet long
down the middle with her finger.
“This is the border.”
I hadn’t heard that word since the time we slept in Kizmel’s
tent in the dark elf camp on the third floor, and the surprise
brought a burst of laughter to my lips—and a fierce glare from
Asuna.
“A-all right…I get it. I understand. Capisce.”
Asuna gave me a scowl back, but she indicated this was
sufficient and put the covers back.

185|P

While we’d landed on a compromise for the bed issue, the
circumstances were a little—no, a lot—different from the tent.
Sleeping on the ground there meant excusing a lot of potential
contact under the general experience of “roughing it.” But in a
proper building, a proper bedroom, a proper bed, there could be
no excuses. The border drawn on the sheets was as fragile and
perilous as the Line of Control in Kashmir.
But for being so susceptible to spontaneous accidents, the
fencer exhibited surprising fortitude toward this situation.
“Well…I’ll sleep on this side,” she said, taking the half farther
away from the window and slipping under the blanket. With her
back to me, she opened her window, pressed a button or two,
then closed it. I heard a swishing sound under the covers, which
was probably her changing into pajamas.
Then she wriggled down deeper until only the back of her head
was visible. It seemed her strategy was to fall asleep as soon as
possible, which seemed like the right call to me, so I tapped the
wall and turned off the lights in the bedroom and living room.
There was a window on the west bedroom wall, and gauzy
moonlight trickled through the lace curtains. The day started off
cloudy but cleared up in the afternoon. Hopefully the weather will
be nice tomorrow, I thought, trying to distract myself as I entered
the side of the bed opposite Asuna.
The bed was about six feet across, so as long as I stayed on the
very left edge, far from the border, I didn’t need to be conscious of
my partner’s presence, physically speaking. Whatever the
mattress was made of, it had just the right mixture of support and
softness, and the blanket was light and as warm as a down
comforter. I had to admit that Asuna was right; the sofa out there
and my heavy-duty camping blanket were a far cry from this kind
of comfort.
My head sank into the massive pillow, and my eyelids closed,
and despite the situation, I felt the sleep fairy sneaking up on me.
There we go—fall asleep, fall asleep, and get an extra room
tomorrow…
“Are you still awake, Kirito?”
“………Ayup.”
186|P

The fairy had scampered away. If she said “Just checking,” what
kind of a snappy response should I have? But the follow-up from
over the border was not what I was expecting.
“You know how there’s that anti-harassment code? The thing
that came up in Mr. Romolo’s workshop on the fourth floor when
you tried to wake me up?”
“Y…yes.”
This ominous topic dispelled my sleepiness entirely. Now I had
no idea where she was taking this.
“I was just thinking…you pushed me over when we were in the
bath.”
“N-no…I was keeping you from going orange.”
“But you pushed me over.”
“………Ayup.”
“So why didn’t the anti-harassment code activate?”
Why didn’t it…?
I didn’t have an answer on the tip of my tongue. I had to think
about it.
“Um…Does it not show up if you’re in a party together…? No,
because we were partied up on the fourth floor…Maybe it
depends on the time of contact…? But no, I don’t remember
touching you for very long on the fourth floor, either…”
“It’s not an issue of how you make contact. When you tried to
wake me up, you just touched my shoulder, and it went off, but it
didn’t happen when you pushed me over naked.”
“P-please don’t say it like that…” I begged.
Indeed, it wasn’t logical that the code activated just from
touching her shoulder, and yet, pressing against her without any
equipment on didn’t do a thing. Was there any other condition
that was different between the workshop and the underground
hot spring, aside from party configuration and time of contact?
“Mmm-hmmmm…”
I chased away the sleep fairy, who was trying to sneak back
into my mind. But the soft, fluffy bed was just so soft and fluffy,
and if it was any softer and fluffier, it would soft…fluff…
“……Ah.”

187|P

The instant I began tumbling off the precipice into sleep was
the hint I needed.
“When it happened…you were sleeping.”
She must have been nodding off, too, because her reply came at
a delay.
“…What? The code activated because I was sleeping? You mean
it won’t go off if you’re awake…?”
“…No, I don’t think that’s it…But that’s the only thing I can
think of…”
“Hmm……”
After another silence of many seconds, my temporary partner
surprised me once more.
“Pinkie…”
“Eh?”
“Hold out your pinkie.”
I wriggled my little finger through the blanket, then
remembered the invisible line.
“But the border—”
“One finger’s worth of trespassing can be overlooked. Hurry it
up.”
“Okay…”
Hesitantly, I stretched my arm, sticking out my pinkie near the
centerline of the bed. After a few moments, what I assumed was
Asuna’s pinkie brushed mine and grabbed it. On instinct, I
squeezed back.
“So, um…what are we doing?”
“Just be quiet.”
“……”
“…The window for the code isn’t popping up. So if we fall
asleep like this, and it’s showing when we wake up, that would
indicate that your theory is correct, to a degree.”
“……Ah, I see…”
The tension drained out of my body. Asuna’s pinkie pressure
eased a little bit, and she whispered, “Well, good night…”
“If the prompt does show up, don’t hit the button in your
sleep.”
“Yeah…I…know…”
188|P

“Good night.”
From that point on, silence fell on the land of the blankets, and
the only thing coming over the border was the faint sound of
sleeping. I closed my eyes again, but the gentle warmth of that
pinkie contact prevented my wits from dispersing to all corners.
I was curious about the workings of the anti-harassment code,
of course, but there were still many things for Asuna and me to do
on this floor yet. We hadn’t finished the “Curse of Stachion” quest,
we had to help advance progress through the floor, the handling
of the guild flag was still up in the air, and tomorrow, we’d be
helping Kizmel with the quest to retrieve the Agate Key. And the
biggest problem of all was the PKers.

189|P

190|P

I’d told myself on numerous occasions that it was pointless
trying to decipher their way of thinking, but I still couldn’t help
myself.
Why were Morte, the dagger user, and the man in the black
poncho trying to make the DKB and ALS fight? Especially when it
was obvious that it would only harm our chances of beating this
game and finding freedom from its electronic prison?
No matter their reasons, I would never forgive them for the act
of attempting to kill Asuna. I would never let their wicked blades
anywhere near her again.
For an instant, I was seized by a shockingly powerful urge.
I didn’t want this pinkie.
I wanted to grab her hand, pull her close, and wrap my arms
around her. I wanted to make it clear that I was going to keep her
safe.
But I couldn’t do that. Our partnership probably wasn’t going
to last forever, and it shouldn’t. Until the day she stood at the lead
of our best and brightest, standing as a symbol of hope for all the
players of the game, I would continue providing her with
whatever help I could, as a beta tester. That was my role.
I let the tension slowly drain out of my body, exhaled, and
tensed my finger one more time, just to feel that the sensation
was still there.
…Good night, I whispered in my mind, and I gave myself up to
sleep at last.

AFTERWORD
Thank you for reading Sword Art Online Progressive 5, “Canon of
the Golden Rule (Start).”
The previous volume originally came out in December 2015,
which means it’s been over two years since we left off. I’m very
sorry about that. I’m also very sorry that this is the first two-part
story in this series!
SAOP has been proceeding at the pace of one floor per volume,
but even then, each volume required some part of the story to be
told in digest form (quests, advancing through the floor, boss
fights), and I always regretted that…So I decided that I wanted to
write as much of this floor as possible this time around. But once I
started, I realized there was too much to contain to one book,
especially with lots of Kizmel material, and the idea of cutting
anything after all that was too much to bear. So I’ve decided to
make this a two-volume story and get it all out of my system.
Because of that, all kinds of things are left hanging at the end of
this book, but the second half should be coming very soon after
this, so please, just have a bit of patience for our arrival at the
seventh floor! Please!
As for the content…I chose to make the theme of the sixth floor
“puzzles” because I always wanted to do a puzzle-based floor, but
I’m also not very good at solving puzzles in dungeons whenever
they show up in RPGs (laughs). Especially in MMOs—when it
requires the coordination of several players at once. I feel like I’m
getting an ulcer imagining myself being the one who screwed up
and got yelled at by everyone else. I plan to put Kirito in just such
a tricky situation in the second half, so let’s all cheer him on and
hope he gets it right the first time!
Some of you might also be worried about how fast Kirito and
Asuna seem to be getting closer by the volume. So am I! The idea

is for the Progressive series to connect to the main series, so
having them be so hunky-dory in the early stages feels like it’s
straining the space-time continuum, but I will continue my
irresponsible policy of leaving it all up to them and trusting it’ll
probably work itself out in the end.
I also have a few announcements…At about the same time as
this book, the Fatal Bullet game should be coming out. It’s set in
the world of GGO, and it’s the first major release that features an
original protagonist, so I hope you enjoy adventuring alongside
Kirito and Asuna. Also, the mobile game Integral Factor is an
MMORPG about conquering Aincrad from the very first floor, just
like Progressive, so you should definitely check it out!
Lastly, to my illustrator, abec, and my editors, Miki and Adachi,
my deepest apologies and thanks for putting up with my edge-ofyour-seat deadline completion! I hope I see the rest of you in the
second half of this book, coming soon!
