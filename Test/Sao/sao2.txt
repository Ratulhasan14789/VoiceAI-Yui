floor to ambush her on.
Logically, she would choose the fourth floor where she could prepare to snipe
quicker. However, my intuition and judgement whispered to me the moment I saw
the library on the fourth floor. My intuition told me that sniper was likely still a
young student in the real world. My judgement told me a student might avoid a
library that would bring up memories of real life.
That prediction was spot-on. The sniper with light blue hair wasted tens of seconds
needlessly ascending that one floor and showed herself on the fifth floor’s
warehouse.
And now, her transient life would dissolve like that of a butterfly that went astray
into a spider’s web.
Aah, if only this was not a mere reduction of binary data in the virtual world, but
the deprivation of an actual life and soul.
If only it was a live body squirming in my arm instead of an avatar.
«That moment» would truly be ever so sweet.
The sniper’s HP shown at the top-right of my vision cut through the five percent
mark.
