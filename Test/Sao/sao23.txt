 There was no need to concern themselves over
any fatal casualties of that ship’s crew either.
And the objective of the operation was to steal a certain technology.
Upon hearing the details, Gabriel’s voice leaked out slightly, overwhelmed by

«Soul TransLation technology». A wondrous machine capable of deciphering
humans’ souls developed by a small organization called «Rath» in the JDSF.
Gabriel had held a strong interest in the full-dive technology born in Japan for
some time now in his pursuit of souls. That was why he fought with the players
from Japan in Gun Gale Online and studied Japanese. He even obtained a set of the
«demonic device», the Nerve Gear, that should have been disposed of without a
single one remaining by spending several tens of thousands of dollars—of course,
he didn’t intend to use it himself, however.
