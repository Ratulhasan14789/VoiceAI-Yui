ssible to execute the ejection procedure from the virtual console set up
in the Underworld too..”
“What will happen if that‟s done?”
Higa gestured as he replied to Koujiro Rinko‟s query.
“A target cube will be extracted from the light cube cluster in the exact middle of
the main shaft and be brought to either control room through the air tubes. That‟s
where the exit is when extracting it.”
After pointing at a rectangular hatch located at a corner of the console desk, he
turned his sight towards the door installed deeper in the room.
A small metal plate was screwed into the door made from aluminum alloy. The
words carved into it were, “Second STL Room”.
Beyond that door were two STL—«Soul TransLators». A young man lay in one,
watched over by Aki Natsuki, a nurse and a Sergeant first class. Playing a major role
since the start of Project Alicization, he, Kirigaya Kazuto, now even had the
capability to chart its course.
Turning back, Kikuoka spoke in a serious tone with his arms crossed.
