he east and west too.
A young man’s shout, much like a scream, rang out from the north side of the plaza
then.
“We can’t hold on any longer! Retreat! Retrea—at!!”
The voice belonged to Guard Chief Jink. Nygr stood up upon hearing that, as
though revitalized, and flared up Alice.
“Look.. just look at that! We should have stayed in the plaza and defended! We will
get killed! They will murder all of uss!!”
Alice shrugged her shoulder and refuted calmly.
“No need to worry; there is all this space. I will hold them back here.”
“As if you can! You can’t possibly do it, not a chance! Even if.. even if you are really
an integrity knight, what can you do alone against so many of those demons?!!”
Nygr still continued crying out despite the goblins’ horrifying silhouettes already
pressing in from the east and west. Ignoring him yet again, Alice glanced behind.
The last of the villagers were still in the plaza, though enough of a distance from
Alice and the rest in the center.
