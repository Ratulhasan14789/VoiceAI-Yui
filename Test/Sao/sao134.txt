 range at the edge in the past!! You witch..
this girl must be a terrible witch!!”
Alice lost her words, jabbed by that fat finger. The clamor from the villagers, the
clashes between weapons resounding from the defense line, and the war cries from
the monsters closing in from the north all felt far away.
Since she began living in the village’s outskirts, Alice had countlessly fell the forest’s
gigantic trees on Nygr’s request. This man had practically writhed to thank her each
time. And yet, he could still spew those words as his family’s fortunes occupied his
entire time; how could—
Alice averted her eye from the middle-aged man with an expression much like the
evil countenance of the orcs and murmured inside.
—How about you deal with it on your own?
—I will simply do as I like. I will take Selka, the elderly Garitta, my parents, and
Kirito away from this village and search for a new home somewhere far away.
She grinded her teeth audibly; she lowered her eyelids.
