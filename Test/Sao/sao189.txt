future issues with the media. If their fully-equipped soldiers were to charge in,
Gabriel and the assault team would be easily annihilated due to the difference in

He planned to escape alone in a small submarine even if it reached the worst-case
scenario. But if he failed to obtain the pivotal light cube, his valiant pursuit of the
human soul would be forced to regress to an irredeemable degree.
Gabriel had already laid out detailed plans for his life after this operation.
First, he would escape to Australia with Alice and hide the light cube and the STL
technology in his villa on the Sovereign Islands. Returning to San Diego via plane,
he would report the failure of the operation to the NSA. Crossing back over to
Australia after the heat died down, he would install a STL machine in the large
basement in his villa and construct a virtual world designed to his whims.
