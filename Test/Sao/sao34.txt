 sunbath.
Alice smiled as she gazed at them for a while before she turned about and spoke.
“Hey, we seem to be having fine weather today, so how about we have lunch all the
way at the eastern hills?”
No one replied.
The log cabin had only two rooms, and this one served as the living room, dining
room, and kitchen with a plain wood table placed right in its middle.
Seated on one of the chairs, similarly plain, was a black-haired youth. Not even
raising his head at Alice’s call, his vacant stare stayed upon a single spot atop the
table.
He never did have much meat on him, but still, he was obviously more slender than
even Alice now. His bony frame was visible even with the loose robe he had on. The
empty right sleeve hanging down languidly from the tip of his shoulders only made
him look all the more tragic.
Light was absent from his eyes, jet-black like his hair. Those two eyes reflected no
more than his locked heart.
