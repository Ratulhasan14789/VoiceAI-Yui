ry language behind some time ago, Eldrie showed the resolute
face of a knight and continued.
“I am obligated to report that I had come across this opportunity for an audience
with you on this particular occasion. Alice-sama.. please return to the Order!
Rather than the assistance of a thousand men, what we need now is your sword!!”
Alice slowly turned down her eye as though avoiding the knight’s forceful gaze.
She knew.
She knew the crackling of the brittle wall shielding the Human World crumbling
away. And of the hardships Knight Commander Bercouli and the newly-formed
Defense Army suffer as they propped it up.
Alice could never repay her debt to the knight commander for his protection and
guidance, and she had yet to lose her sense of unity with those in the Order of the
Integrity Knights, including Eldrie. That said, that was insufficient to spur her to
battle.
